0.1.8
- added check to `check_file` to identify potential misspellings indicated by parent and child
  names being similar, but not identical
  
0.1.7

- fixed an overflow error when building on Windows

0.1.5
- fixed merge conflict causing code to not compile
- bug fix to output table produced when validating type material

0.1.4
- removed the 'check_suffix' command since it produces excessive numbers of false positives
  as a result of names such as g__Examplus_A, g__Examplus_B occuring without a corresponding 
  g__Examplus due to the merging a splitting of same taxa.

0.0.19
- added check to "check_file" to flag species names where the genus name is a placeholder and the specific name is Latinized

0.0.18

0.0.13
- changed default checks such that species assignments are ignored

0.0.12
- added additional validation checks to the 'species_clusters' method

0.0.11
- updated 'ncbi_tax_diff' command to remove GTDB metadata requirement

0.0.10
- added 'species_clusters' method for validation classifications in species clusters
- added 'suffix_table' method
