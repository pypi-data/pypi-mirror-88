    caption: This panel shows the template T1-weighted image (if several T1w images
      were found), with contours delineating the detected brain mask and brain tissue
      segmentations.

      space(s). Hover on the panels with the mouse pointer to transition between both
      spaces.

    caption: Inhomogeneities of the *B0* field introduce (oftentimes severe) spatial distortions
      along the phase-encoding direction of the image. Utilizing two or more images with different
      phase-encoding polarities (PEPolar) or directions, it is possible to estimate the inhomogeneity
      of the field. The plot below shows a reference EPI (echo-planar imaging) volume generated
      using two or more EPI images with varying phase-encoding blips.
    description: Hover on the panels with the mouse pointer to also visualize the intensity of the
      inhomogeneity of the field in Hertz.

    caption: Average b=0 that serves for reference in early preprocessing steps.
    descriptions: The reference b=0 is obtained as the voxel-wise median across
      all b=0 found in the dataset, after accounting for signal drift.
      The red contour shows the brain mask calculated using this reference b=0.

    caption: Diffusion-weighted data and anatomical data (EPI-space and T1w-space)
      were aligned with <code>mri_coreg</code> (FreeSurfer).
      WARNING - <code>bbregister</code> refinement rejected.
    description: Note that nearest-neighbor interpolation is used in this reportlet
      in order to highlight potential slice Inhomogeneities and other artifacts, whereas
      the final images are resampled using cubic B-Spline interpolation.
