# Pyclim Engine
Easy to use library for creating CLI-based games in Python.\
This project is for fun/learn purposes.

## Example
Note: Pyclim Engine is very experimental and there are millions of bugs floating there.
Help me fixing them by contributing.
```py
import threading
import time
import os

import pyclim

screen = pyclim.Screen()

# A prefab of a controller that moves in 4  directions
player = pyclim.Player(parent=screen)
thread = threading.Thread(target=player.move).start()

# Main game loop
while True:
    print(screen.update(player)) # Printing the latest update of the screen
    time.sleep(0.25)
    os.system("cls") # Clears the command line. For linux use "clear"
```
