Description: Pulling
        =============
        Pulling is an open source python repository for working with files of different extensions. Documentation in English can be found here - https://github.com/ItYaS/pulling/wiki.
        The repository now supports .txt .rtf .pdf .docx .csv .avro .json formats.
        
        Future
        ======================
        Such a repository can be extended for life. That's what I will do. But the next version (where there will be parsing from other formats) will not be released soon. So, keep this repository and be patient.
        
        In the future, I want to parse .orc .rcf .parquet .feather (and one day .doc .odt), add conversion to other extensions for all formats, add new functions, and new formats.
        
        Version 1.4
        ======================
        - The code readability was also fixed and all unnecessary loops were removed.
        - Fixed bugs and architecture
        - Removed unnecessary code
        - Improved readability and usability
