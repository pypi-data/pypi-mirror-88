Description: BTLEWEATHERSTATION
        ==================
        
        This Python module uses Bluetooth (BtLE) to connect to an Oregon Scientific
        weather station and retrieve the current, minimum and maximum temperatures
        and humidities, for the internal (0) and external (1-3) sensors.
        
        The module can be run as a 'main' utilities ("python3 -m btleWeatherStation")
        or used as a module in other scripts.
        
        For now, all documentation is inside the module classes.  The __main__.py file
        gives an example of how to use it.
