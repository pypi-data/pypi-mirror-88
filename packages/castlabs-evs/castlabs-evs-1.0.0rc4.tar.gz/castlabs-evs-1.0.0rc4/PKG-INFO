Description: `castlabs-evs` is a package that provides a client for the [EVS service](https://github.com/castlabs/electron-releases/wiki/EVS) for [Electron for Content Security](https://github.com/castlabs/electron-releases). EVS provides production Widevine/VMP signing of application packages derived from official releases of Electron for Content Security. It is a free service, but requires signup to use.
        
        `castlabs-evs` supports Python 3.7+ and can be installed with:
        ```
        % python3 -m pip install castlabs-evs
        ```
        
        This installs the EVS client which provides Python and CLI interfaces for account handling and VMP signing. If the pip module binary directory is in your `PATH` the two convenience scripts `evs-account` and `evs-vmp` can be used in place of `python3 -m <module>` in the examples below.
        
        The CLI interfaces are interactive by default, asking for any information they cannot load from its configuration, unless they are provided through CLI arguments or environment variables. This behaviour can be overridden by not providing a TTY on STDIN, or by passing the `--no-ask` option or setting EVS_NO_ASK in the environment, in which case any missing required information will trigger a runtime error instead, making them more suitable for automation.
        
        The Python interfaces are not currently documented, but the CLI provides help sections that can be accessed:
        ```
        % python3 -m castlabs_evs.account --help
        usage: account.py [-h] [-v] [-n]
                          {signup,sup,confirm-signup,csup,update,up,reset,res,confirm-reset,cres,refresh,r,deauth,da,reauth,ra,delete,del}
                          ...
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
          -n, --no-ask          enable non-interactive mode
        
        commands:
          {signup,sup,confirm-signup,csup,update,up,reset,res,confirm-reset,cres,refresh,r,deauth,da,reauth,ra,delete,del}
            signup (sup)        sign up for EVS account

            refresh (r)         refresh authorization tokens
            deauth (da)         discard any authorization tokens
            reauth (ra)         discard any authorization tokens & refresh
            delete (del)        delete EVS account
        ```
        ```
        % python3 -m castlabs_evs.vmp --help

          -n, --no-ask          enable non-interactive mode
        
        commands:
          {verify,v,sign,s,verify-pkg,vp,sign-pkg,sp}
            verify (v)          verify signature
