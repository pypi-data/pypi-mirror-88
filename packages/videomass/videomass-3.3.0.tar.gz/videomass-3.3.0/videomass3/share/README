When you run the program for the first time, the contents of this folder will 
be copied to the user's Videomass configuration directory, according to the 
conventions of each operating system which are:

        Linux:       '~/.config/videomass'
        MacOs:       '~/Library/Application Support/videomass'
        Windows:     'C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\videomass'
        
`videomass.conf' and `videomassWin32.conf' (for MS Windows) are the main 
Videomass configuration files and are used for storing user preferences and 
to import essential data for the program.

Furthermore, the Videomass configuration directory is also used to load the 
presets inside the 'presets/' folder which have the ".prst" format extension 
and contain text with JSON data structure.
