Installation

Stable release
--------------

To install scope, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install scope-coupler

This is the preferred method to install scope, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

.. warning::
    Since ``scope`` is still under active development, there is no "stable release" yet.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

From sources
------------

The sources for scope can be downloaded from AWI's `Gitlab repo`_.

You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://gitlab.awi.de/pgierz/scope

Or download the `tarball`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl  -OL https://gitlab.awi.de/pgierz/scope/tarball/master

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py install


.. _Gitlab repo: https://gitlab.awi.de/pgierz/scope
.. _tarball: https://gitlab.awi.de/pgierz/scope/tarball/master
