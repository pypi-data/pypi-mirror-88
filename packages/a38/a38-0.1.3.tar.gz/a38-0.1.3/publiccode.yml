    shortDescription: |
      parse and generate Italian Fattura Elettronica
    longDescription: >
      This library implements a declarative data model similar to Django models,
      that is designed to describe, validate, serialize and parse Italian
      Fattura Elettronica data.

      Only part of the specification is implemented, with more added as needs
      will arise. Anyone is welcome to implement the missing pieces they need
      and send a pull request: the idea is to have a good, free (as in freedom)
      library to make billing in Italy with Python easier for everyone.

      The library can generate various kinds of fatture that pass validation,
      and can parse all the example XML files distributed by fatturapa.gov.it
