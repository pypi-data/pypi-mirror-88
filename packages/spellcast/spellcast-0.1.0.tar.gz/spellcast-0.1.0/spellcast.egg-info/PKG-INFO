        ====
        
        Send locally stored videos to your Smart TV or other UPnP/DLNA media renderer.
        This is intended as the simplest approach for sending a video through the local
        network.
        
        Spellcast works by setting up a temporary HTTP server that hosts only the video
        file, and sending its URI to the rendering device via UPnP protocols.
        
        ## Setup
        
        This is a Python 3 application. It uses
        [Twisted](https://pypi.org/project/Twisted/) and
        [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/). For your convenience you can
        easily install it with pip:
        
        ```sh
        python3 -m pip install spellcast
        ```
        
        Or, alternatively, you can set everything up in a virtual environment as
        follows:
        
        ```sh
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Pass the video file as argument, and Spellcast casts to the first media renderer
        found on the network:
        
        ```sh
        cast /path/to/video.mp4
        ```
        
        Or:
        
        ```sh
        python -m spellcast /path/to/video.mp4
        ```
        
        ## Acknowledgements
        
        This implementation borrows a lot from the
        [video2smarttv](https://github.com/probonopd/video2smarttv) project by
        [probonopd](https://github.com/probonopd), which in turn uses
        [dankrause's](https://github.com/dankrause) solution for [SSDP
        discovery](https://gist.github.com/dankrause/6000248). Thanks go to all
        developers involved!
