Description: # Fake W1 thermometer
        
        **README**
        
        This package wil generate a fake DS18B20 temperature sensor like on a raspberry Pi so developement on other devices is possible without the actual connecting of a temperature sensor. It mimics the behaviour of this sensor. The sensor takes a min and max temperature and oscillates between this given range by 0.1 degrees celcius.
        
        **Version:**
        0.1
        
        **Usage:**
        Import an instantaniate the class, the class takes an minimum and maximum temperature, an output dir and sensor number. This sensornumber makes it possible to instantaniate a number of sensors. On initialize the class will generate a random temperature between the min and max temperature so you get different readings per sensor. I've added a example.py to give you an idea on how to run this package.
