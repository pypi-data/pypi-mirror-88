        ========================
        
        HTML transformations for Plone sites.
        
        The purpose of this package is *not* to provide new functionality (for now)
        but to factor out existing functionality from an existing monolitic Zope product.
        Thus, it is more likely to lose functionality during further development
        (as parts of it will be forked out into their own packages,
        or some functionality may even become obsolete because there are better
        alternatives in standard Plone components).

        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        1.1 (unreleased)
        ----------------
        
        - Support for `FolderishAnimation` (visaplan.plone.animations_)
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.0.5 (2020-12-16)
        ------------------
        
        Improvements:
        
        - In ``configure.zcml``, don't  import "zcml-empty" packages anymore
        - Support both Products.unitracc < 3.5 (with ``@@versioninformation`` browser)
          and >= 3.5 (where that browser was moved to the policy package)

        1.0.4 (2020-06-12)
        ------------------
        
        Bugfixes:
        
        - ``.utils.extract_2uids`` now recognizes ``@@resolveuid`` links as well
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.0.3 (2019-12-18)
