Description: # Agentpy - Agent-based modeling in Python
        
        Agentpy is an open-source framework for the development and analysis of
        agent-based models in Python.
        This project is still in an early stage of development.
        If you have feedback, need help, or want to contribute,
        please write to joel.foramitti@uab.cat.
        
        **Main features:**
        
        - Design of agent-based models with complex procedures.
        - Creation of custom agent types, environments, and networks.
        - Agent lists that can forward attribute calls and select agent groups.
        - Experiments with repeated iterations, parameter samples, and distinct scenarios.
        - Output data that can be saved, loaded, and re-arranged for further analysis.
        - Tools for sensitivity analysis, interactive output, animations, and plots.
        - Compatibility with NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, networkx, and SALib.
