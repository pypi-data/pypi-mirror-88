        =================
        
        Mopidy-SoundCloud is currently kept on life support by the Mopidy core
        developers. It is in need of a more dedicated maintainer.
        
        If you want to be the maintainer of Mopidy-SoundCloud, please:
        
        1. Make 2-3 good pull requests improving any part of the project.
        
        2. Read and get familiar with all of the project's open issues.
        
        3. Send a pull request removing this section and adding yourself as the

           description, please refer to the previous pull requests and state that
           you've familiarized yourself with the open issues.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Install by running::
        
            sudo python3 -m pip install Mopidy-SoundCloud
        
        See https://mopidy.com/ext/soundcloud/ for alternative installation methods.
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        #. You must register for a user account at https://soundcloud.com/
        
        #. You need a SoundCloud authentication token for Mopidy from
           https://mopidy.com/authenticate
        
        #. Add the authentication token to the ``mopidy.conf`` config file::
        
            [soundcloud]
            auth_token = 1-1111-1111111
            explore_songs = 25
        
        #. Use ``explore_songs`` to restrict the number of items returned.
        
        
        Troubleshooting
        ===============
        
        If you're having trouble with audio playback from SoundCloud, make sure you
        have the "ugly" plugin set from GStreamer installed for MP3 support. The
        package is typically named ``gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly`` or similar, depending
        on OS and distribution. The package isn't a strict requirement for Mopidy's
        core, so you may be missing it.
