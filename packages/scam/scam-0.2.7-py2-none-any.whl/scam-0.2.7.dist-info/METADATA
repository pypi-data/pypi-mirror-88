Multiple of the same substring found in file B will return only the first instance of that substring. 

Issues- 
Python files featuring a heavy amount of print statements may cause skewed data. 

## Test Files
Test files can be found in: 
    <dir>/lib/python3.8/site-packages/source/test_file
there are python files and .txt files, make sure to change the file filter down below to be able to see either of them.
