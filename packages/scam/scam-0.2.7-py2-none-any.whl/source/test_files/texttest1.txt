Hi all,

The university has designated June 10th a day of reflection, ad encouraged faculty and staff to pause their normal duties to consider the ramifications and work towards solutions to racism. As such, I'll be cancelling our normal lecture tomorrow and will be engaging in reflection and workshops designated for this purpose.

If you'd like to know or become involved, you can find information here (copied/pasted from President's Fuch's email):

#ShutDownAcademia #ShutDownSTEM  https://www.shutdownstem.com/action tomorrow, June 10, Shut Down for a Day, Build Better Tomorrows, seeks to ensure that white and non-Black People of Color educate themselves and define an actionable plan for progress against anti-Black racism and for Black lives. This effort encourages faculty and staff to redirect their time, efforts and expertise away from their normal work activities toward these and related goals.

If you have questions, or need to chat, please let me know.

Regards,
Jeremiah Blanchard
