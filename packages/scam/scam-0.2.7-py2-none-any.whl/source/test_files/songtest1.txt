Colbalt blue
Slipping down reddened cheeks
Turns a melancholy violet

Beneath an orange-scented sun
Today I can repaint my heart anew

The beautiful view through the window
I trace my sorrow through the glass with my fingertip

The colors become mixed and muddied
But in the instant I collapsed
I caught a glimpse through the cracks
And realized

It's okay,
The color's still there
A collection of chipped off paint

Forever
Vivid and beautiful
We can step out now
Walk through the door

The stagnant sky
And the tattered clouds
Still we embrace them

The city passing by,
The hidden pigments
Side by side, they don't look so bad

No single color dominates
We are right here
A rainbow of marginal

Vivid marginal
