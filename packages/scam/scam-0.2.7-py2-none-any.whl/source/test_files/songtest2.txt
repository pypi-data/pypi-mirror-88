Shades of Cobalt blue
Slipping down my cold and reddened cheeks, with puddles of grey
Mix into a darkened, melancholy violet

With an orange-scented sun, with white clouds of which are not few,
and fields of light green, today I can repaint my heart to be anew

The beautiful view through the window draws me to trace my sorrow
Through the glass with my fingertips, a paintbrush, I draw my spirit and i see

The colors mixed and muddied all like all before I could stop it
But in the same instant I had collapsed
I caught a glimpse through the cracks, what I saw showed me all I would need
I realized
#testing
Don't worry,
The color's all still there with me
A collection of chipped off paint scattered underneath me

Forever
Vivid and beautiful
It's okay now, we can all step out now
Walk outside through the door

The stagnant sky before us, the tattered clouds around us, we
Still embrace them, still embrace them, today

The city passing by,
All the hidden pigments
Side by side, they both don't look so bad when amidst a rainbow

All around us, no single color dominates
We are right here, in a beautiful painting
A rainbow of marginal

Vivid marginal
