### API Credentials

The `TNZAPI` needs your TNZ API credentials. You can either pass these
directly to the constructor (see the code below) or via environment variables.

```python
from tnzapi import TNZAPI

client = TNZAPI()

client.Sender = "user@example.com"
client.APIKey = "ABC123"
```

### Send an SMS

```python
from tnzapi import TNZAPI

client = TNZAPI(
    Sender="user@example.com",
    APIKey="ABC123",
)

request = client.Send.SMS(
    Reference="Test",
    MessageText = "Test SMS Message click [[Reply]] to opt out",
    Recipients = ["+64211231234"],
)

response = request.SendMessage()

print(repr(response))
```

### Send a Fax Document

```python
from tnzapi import TNZAPI

client = TNZAPI(
    Sender="user@example.com",

request = client.Send.Fax(
    Recipients = "+6491232345",

response = request.SendMessage()

print(repr(response))
```

### Make a Call - Text-to-Speech (TTS)

```python
from tnzapi import TNZAPI

client = TNZAPI(
    Sender="user@example.com",
    APIKey="ABC123",
)

request = client.Send.TTS(
    Recipients = "+64211232345",
    Reference = "Voice Test - 64211232345",
    MessageToPeople = "Hi there!"
)

request.AddKeypad(Tone=1,RouteNumber="+6499293000",Play="You pressed 1")

response = request.SendMessage()

print(repr(response))
```

### Make a Call - Upload MP3 / Wav File

client = TNZAPI(
    Sender="user@example.com",
    APIKey="ABC123",
