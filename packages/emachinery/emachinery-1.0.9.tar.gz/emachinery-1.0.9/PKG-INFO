        ## Changelog
        
        *1.0.9*
        - (Video@Bilibili) Demonstration the effectiveness of the current loop decoupling (PMSM).
        - Allow velocity-open-loop and current-closed-loop for sweep frequency analysis.
        - Automatically add path2acmsimc is the user-specified path does not exist.
        - Remember last user input for C-based simulation.
        
        *1.0.8*
        - I was stupid. Version 1.0.7 did not do its job.
        
        *1.0.7*
        - Add the resource "makefile" to the package.
        
        *1.0.6*
        - Remember last user input for path2acmsimcv5 and add config.json to gui/
        - Publish acmsimcv5 along with the package.
        
        *1.0.5*
        - Add sweep-frequency and bode-plot feature.
        - gmake compile .c program, execute .exe, collect .dat, and ggplot.
