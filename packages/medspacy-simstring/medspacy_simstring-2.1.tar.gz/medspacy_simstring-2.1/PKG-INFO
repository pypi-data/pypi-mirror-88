Description: # SimString Python Package
        
        Orginal version by [chokkan](https://github.com/chokkan/simstring). New version (compiles under macOS) from [here](https://github.com/blinkhealth/simstring-python-package)
        
        Windows/Anaconda/VisualStudio specific steps:
        
        1. Make sure that iconv is available to your desired conda environment: `conda install -c conda-forge libiconv`
        2. Then, open a Visual Studio Developer Prompt (e.g. “VS 2015 x64 Developer Command Prompt” or “VS 2015 x86 Developer Command Prompt”)
        3. Now you can any of these commands to build or install: `python setup.py build && python setup.py install`
        4. **NOTE**: If there is a failure that `rc.exe` cannot be found, add the appropriate WindowKits binary path to `PATH`. More info on this [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14372706/visual-studio-cant-build-due-to-rc-exe).
