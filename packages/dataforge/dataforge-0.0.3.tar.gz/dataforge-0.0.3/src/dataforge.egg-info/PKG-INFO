        Dataforge
        =========
        
        .. note:: Tested with Python 3.7.
        
        Dataforge is a Python package containing tools for creating and packaging data
        products.

        Installation
        ============
        
        .. note:: Installation in a virtual environment of the type created by the
                  `venv module <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_ or
                  `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_ is highly
                  recommended.
        
        Dataforge uses `xmarshal <https://github.com/hexdump/xmarshal>`_, which is
        compiled using `Cython <https://cython.readthedocs.io/>`_. Thus, prior to
        installation, you will need a C compiler:
        
        Linux
            ``sudo apt-get install build-essential``
        
        Mac OS X
            Install Appleâ€™s XCode from the App Store
        
        Windows
            Install `Microsoft's C++ Build Tools <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/>`_ 
        
        To install dataforge::
            
            pip install dataforge
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        For ease of use, many arguments and options for executable commands as well as
        many function arguments may be specified in a file called ``config.yaml``
        located at the root of your project. For example, you could specify arguments
        and options for the ``redcap_export`` command by creating a ``config.yaml``
        file containing something like this::
        
            sources.redcap.api:
                url: https://redcap.uchicago.edu/api/
                project_name: MyREDCapProject
                outdir: tmp/redcap
        
        
        REDCap
        ======
        
        Management of API Tokens
        ------------------------
        
        To access a REDCap project via the API, you will need to obtain a REDCap API
        token. To avoid having to enter the token each time you export data, it is
        convenient to add the token to your system keyring. You may do this with the
        following command::
        
            keyring set <redcap_hostname> [<project_name>]
        
        where ``<redcap_hostname>`` is the hostname of your REDCap server (e.g.,
        ``redcap.uchicago.edu``) and ``<project_name>`` is an abbreviated (no spaces)
        name of the REDCap project (e.g., ``MyREDCapProject``). Although specifying a
        project name is not required, doing so will allow you to store API tokens for
        multiple projects. When you are asked to enter a password, enter the API token
        you obtained for your project.
        
        .. warning:: Do not store your API token in a plaintext or otherwise
                     unencrypted file, and do not write it down on a piece of paper.
                     If another person were to obtain your API token, he or she would
                     have the same access to your REDCap project as you do. If there
                     is ever a possibility that your token has been compromised, you
                     should immediately regenerate your token.
