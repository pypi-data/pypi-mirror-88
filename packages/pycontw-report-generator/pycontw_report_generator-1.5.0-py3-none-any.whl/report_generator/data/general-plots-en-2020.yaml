      PyCon TW {{ jinja2_tag_year }} had an exciting and fulfilling time because of your help. This year,
      we provided more than {{ jinja2_tag_FA_amount }} TWD (about {{ jinja2_tag_FA_amount_USD }} USD) financial aid
      to engage a wider communities by offering them free or discount ticket, transportation support, or accommodation.
      For example, people who have significantly contributed to the Python communities,
      or people and students who are not able to attend due to economic considerations.
      This greatly enhanced our community diversity. This became possible only because of you,
      our sponsors.
      </p>

      <p>
      This year, we have in total {{ jinja2_tag_total_attendee_number }} python enthusiast who joined us virtually or
      in person in Tainan, Taiwan. Most of them who had been in Taiwan were joining in person. Because of COVID-19
      impact this year, most foreign participants were joining via our virtual meet up infrastructure. For example,
      one of our Keynote speaker, Mariatta, likes it very much and
      <a href=https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/1302081926547660800>
      talked about it on her twitter.</a>

      This year, {{ jinja2_tag_proposals }} brilliant talks were shared with the participants.
      The acceptance rate of proposal is {{ jinja2_tag_acceptance_rate }}.

      All the talks are published on youtube. You could find them in the following link:
