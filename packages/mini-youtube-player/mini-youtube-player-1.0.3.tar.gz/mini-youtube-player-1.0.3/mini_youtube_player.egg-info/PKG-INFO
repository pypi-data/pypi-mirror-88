Description: ## mini-youtube-player
        
        **Search and play videos on youtube in cli**
        
        Main features:
        *  Search for Videos or Playlists on youtube
        *  View the search results
        *  Play a video or only listen to audio
        *  View a history of recently played videos

        That's it. mini-youtube-player is not intended to have many features.
