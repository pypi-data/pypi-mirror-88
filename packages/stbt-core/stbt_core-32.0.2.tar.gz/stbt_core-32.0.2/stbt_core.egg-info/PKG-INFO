        This package contains the `stbt_core` open-source Python APIs that you can use
        in test-scripts written for running on the [Stb-tester Platform]. The primary
        purpose of this package is to make the `stbt_core` library easy to install
        locally for IDE linting & autocompletion.
        
        This package doesn't support video-capture, so `get_frame()` and `frames()`
        won't work -- but you will be able to run `match()` if you specify the `frame`
        parameter explicitly, for example by loading a screenshot from disk with
        `load_image()`.
        
        This package doesn't include remote-control integrations, so `press()` and
        similar functions won't work.
        
        This package doesn't bundle the Tesseract OCR engine, so `ocr()` and
        `match_text()` won't work.
