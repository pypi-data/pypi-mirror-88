"""The :class:`Pipeline` class is a composable a stream processor. It consists of a chain of
:class:`slurry.abc.Section`, which each handle a single stream processing operation.

The stream processing results are accessed by calling :meth:`Pipeline.tap` to create an
output channel. Each pipeline can have multiple open taps, each receiving a copy of the
output stream.

The pipeline can also be extended dynamically with new pipeline sections with
:meth:`Pipeline.extend`, adding additional processing.
