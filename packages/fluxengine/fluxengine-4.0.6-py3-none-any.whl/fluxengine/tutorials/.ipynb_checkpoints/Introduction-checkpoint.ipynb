    "This workshop uses Jupyter notebooks. This is a convenient way to combined text and images with code. You'll find Python code examples embedded in the text tutorial. You can run these examples by clicking the run (play) button. The code can also be edited and ran again so that you can see the consequences of changes to the code. To start again from the beginning you can reset the entire notebook by choosing `Kernel` from the top menu, then `Restart & clear output`.\n",

    "When you first open a Jupyter notebook the working directory is set to the directory containing the Jupyter notebook. For most of the exercises in this tutorial we'll want the working directory to be set to the root FluxEngine directory, which is one directory up. Set the working directory by running the code below (don't worry if you don't understand it, the important thing is that you run it at the start):"

    "It is important to verify that FluxEngine, and its dependencies, have been installed correctly. This will prevent problems arising later, and gives us confidence that the flux calculation is being performed correctly by running a known scenario and comparing it to previously published data. This is all handled automatically using a verification script. If you have already ran the verification script when you first installed FluxEngine you do not have to do this again. If you haven't already, then do this by running the code below. It will take about ten minutes to run, but you can continue with the rest of the tutorial while you wait, remembering to check back to make sure you got a message saying \"Validation successful! All values are within threshold limits\" when it has finished."

The easiest way to avoid this is by installing Notepad++ (a free lightweight text editor), and using this to edit configuration files.\n",

Notice that tokens are used to represent the year and month (`<YYYY>` and `<MM>`). These are substituded for the numerical representation of the current year and month when FluxEngine runs, allowing different input files to be selected for different time steps.\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Extra info:</b> There is a general pattern to specifying data layers which is `datalayername_suffix`. You've already seen the use of the `_path` and `_prod` suffix to define file paths and product names, but others can be used to define, for example, minimum and maximum allowed bounds for the input data, or to perform preprocessing such as unit conversions. [The instructions](https://github.com/oceanflux-ghg/FluxEngine/blob/master/FluxEngineV3_instructions.pdf) (section 7.6.1) provides more information on using different suffixes to change the way input data layers are handled.\n",
