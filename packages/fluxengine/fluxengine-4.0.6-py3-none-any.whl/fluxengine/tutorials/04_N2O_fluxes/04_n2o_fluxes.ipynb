    "### Input data specification\n",
    "The first thing to do is to change our input data specification. Open the newly copied configuration file (`N2O_rapid_N00.conf`) and scroll to input specification section of the configuration file. Where possible, we want to use inputs from our MEMENTO netCDF file for the cruise (`copied_data/MEMENTO_N2O/N2O_onedeggrid_monthly_2014_10.nc`). This means you should update the input data layer path and product names for the atmospheric and aqueous pN<sub>2</sub>O, SST, and salinity. Make sure you set the product names correctly (you can find these either from the bullet point list above, or by opening the file in Panoply and reading the metadata for each variable. Note that for the atmospheric and aqueous gas partial pressures the datalayer name will still have 'co2' in it. This does not matter as it really just stands for whichever gas we are interested in calculating the fluxes for.\n",
    "\n",
    "For air pressure we will use the ECMWF data, so specify the path as `copied_data/201410_OCF-PRE-GLO-1M-100-ECMWF.nc`. Using Panoply to open this file you will see that the correct product name for mean sea level air pressure is `msl_mean`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For wind speed we want the CCMP data so specify the path as `copied_data/ccmp_v2_rebinned_2014_month10.nc` and use `windspeed` for the product name. If you open this file in Panoply you will see that there are no variables for the second and third moment of wind speed. Not to worry - we can use FluxEngine's preprocessing feature to approximate these using the second and third power of wind speed. To do this use the same path and product name as you used for the wind speed, but add the following preprocessing functions:\n",
    "```\n",
    "windu10_moment2_preprocessing = pow2\n",
    "windu10_moment3_preprocessing = pow3\n",
    "```\n",

    "Some of our input data are not in the correct units for FluxEngine to work with. Section 6 of [the manual](https://github.com/oceanflux-ghg/FluxEngine/blob/master/FluxEngineV4_instructions.pdf) tells us that air pressure should be supplied in millibars, but the ECMWF data are in pascals. We can use a preprocessing function to tell FluxEngine to convert this into the correct units before using it in the calculation. At the bottom of the air pressure input specification, add a new line:\n",
    "`pressure_preprocessing = pascal_to_millibar`\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to make one final change to the input data specification. You may have noticed that the netCDF file containing the MEMENTO data provided the atmospheric N<sub>2</sub>O values as partial pressure rather than a molar fraction. This is not a problem, because FluxEngine will convert between the two, but we need to tell FluxEngine which input we are providing. To do this we should change `vgas_air_path` and `vgas_air_prod` to `pgas_air_path` and `pgas_air_prod`. FluxEngine also expects gas partial pressure data to be in microatm but the MEMENTO data we have uses nanoatm. We will use another preprocessing function to make this conversion:\n",

Scrolling to near the top of the configuration file you will see that the `axes_data_layer` option is currently set to `sstfnd`, which is extracted from our MEMENTO AMT cruise data file. If you open this file with Panoply (`copied_data/MEMENTO_N2O/N2O_onedeggrid_monthly_2014_10.nc`) you will see that the spatial dimensions are named `longitude` and `latitude`. This is ideal, because those are the names already set for `longitude_prod` and `latitude_prod`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly the `time_prod` option is set to `time`, which is what we need for the CCMP and ECMWF data. Unfortunately, not all of our input data uses `time` as their temporal dimension name. The MEMENTO AMT netCDF file uses `month` instead. We can override the default `time` for these inputs by adding the following lines (ideally, just after the product name for the corresponding input field):\n",
    "```\n",
    "sstfnd_timeDimensionName = month\n",
    "salinity_timeDimensionName = month\n",
    "pgas_air_timeDimensionName = month\n",
    "pgas_sw_timeDimensionName = month\n",

    "### Gas settings and gas transfer velocity parameterisation\n",
    "Next, we need to tell FluxEngine to use the [Nightingale 2000](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/1999GB900091) gas transfer velocity. We are using this parameterisation because there is a version available which estimates the effect of surfactants on gas transfer, and this will allow us to compare like-for-like later in this tutorial. Find the line that reads `k_parameterisation = k_Wanninkhof2014` and change it to `k_parameterisation = k_Nightingale2000`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to specify the gas that we will calculate fluxes for. This is needed to correctly calculate the solubility of the gas and to correctly perform the Schmidt number calculation. Add the following lines after the `k_parameterisation` line:\n",
    "```\n",
    "GAS = N2O #calculating fluxes for nitrous oxide, not CO2\n",
    "ATMGAS = \"P\" #Atmospheric gas data is supplied as partial pressure\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Output file specification\n",
    "Finally, we should specify a meaningful output directory and filename. Scroll to the output path specification section of the configuration file and modify `output_dir` and `output_file` to look like this:\n",

[Pereira et al (2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-018-0136-2.pdf?origin=ppub) developed a parameterisation for estimating the suppression effect of surfactants from skin sea surface temperature.\n",
