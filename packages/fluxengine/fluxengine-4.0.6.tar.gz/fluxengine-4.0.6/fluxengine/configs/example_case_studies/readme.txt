This folder contains example configuration files which correspond to the submitted publication "The FluxEngine air-sea gas flux toolbox: simplified interface and extensions for in situ analysis and multiple sparingly soluble gases" by Holding et al., submitted to Ocean Science. Note that these are supplied in the interest of reproducibility and to provide examples. The accompanying data, while generally publically available, is not distributed with FluxEngine.
