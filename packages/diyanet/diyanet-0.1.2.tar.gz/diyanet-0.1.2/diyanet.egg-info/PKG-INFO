        ### API
        All methods described below are members of `Diyanet` class
        - `get_countries`: `() -> Iterator[Country]` => Iterates through all available countries
        - `get_states`: `(country: Country) -> Iterator[State]` => Iterates through all available states
        - `get_regions`: `(state: State) -> Iterator[Region]` => Iterates through all available regions
        - `get_country` / `get_state`/ `get_region` => Takes a `name` (and depending on the context, a geographical unit that covers itself) and returns if it finds something that matches with given name. If there isn't any match, it raises a `ValueError`.
