  * sge.mouse Functions

This module provides functions related to the mouse input.

Some other mouse functionalities are provided through attributes of
"sge.game.mouse".  These attributes are listed below.

The mouse can be in either absolute or relative mode.  In absolute
mode, the mouse has a position.  In relative mode, the mouse only
moves. Which mode the mouse is in depends on the values of
"sge.game.grab_input" and "sge.game.mouse.visible".

sge.game.mouse.x
sge.game.mouse.y

   If the mouse is in absolute mode and within a view port, these
   attributes indicate the position of the mouse in the room, based on
   its proximity to the view it is in.  Otherwise, they will return
   "-1".

   These attributes can be assigned to safely, but doing so will not
   have any effect.

sge.game.mouse.z

   The Z-axis position of the mouse cursor's projection in relation to
   other window projections.  The default value is "10000".

sge.game.mouse.sprite

   Determines what sprite will be used to represent the mouse cursor.
   Set to "None" for the default mouse cursor.

sge.game.mouse.visible

   Controls whether or not the mouse cursor is visible.  If this is
   "False" and "sge.game.grab_input" is "True", the mouse will be in
   relative mode.  Otherwise, the mouse will be in absolute mode.
