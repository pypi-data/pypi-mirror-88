Description: The Seclusion Game Engine ("SGE") is a general-purpose 2-D game engine.
        It takes care of several details for you so you can focus on the game
        itself.  This makes more rapid game development possible, and it also
        makes the SGE easy to learn.
        
        This implementation of the SGE uses Pygame as a backend.
