Description: Asyncio Tasks Tools
        ======================
        
        The [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) module,  from standar library since 3.4, is basic for the coroutines and tasks. You need to
        study first this module because it's not really easy.
        
        This module allows you to work with asyncio coroutines and schedule some
        tasks.
        
        These tasks can be build in a really generic way, like an independet loop.
        
        The tools in this module can help you to manage your coroutines and succeed.
