HS3 Shell
=========

The HS3 Shell (**hs3sh**) is a command processor created to interact with Amazon
S3 and compatible storage services.

It's main intention is to test S3 compatible storage services against Amazon S3
without having to deal with the hard-to-remember parameters required by tools
like *awscli* or *s3curl.pl*.

Features

*   Connect to Amazon S3 as well as compatible storage services
*   Uses profiles for easy switching between S3 providers
*   Create, discover and delete buckets
*   Discover, write, read and copy objects
*   Multipart upload
*   Deal with metadata and versions
*   Work with ACLs (yet incomplete)
*   Generate pre-signed URLs

------------

You need to have at least Python 3.5 installed to run **hs3sh**.

It depends on the `boto3 <http://boto3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ for
communication with Amazon S3 and compatible stores.
