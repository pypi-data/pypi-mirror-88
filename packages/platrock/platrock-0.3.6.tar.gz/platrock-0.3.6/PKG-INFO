Description: # Description
        PlatRock is a multi-model software for the numericla simulation of rockfalls. This scientific tool implements rock propagation algorithms on 2D and 3D terrain and gives statistical data about resulting trajectories.
        
        
        # Prerequisites
        At the moment PlatRock is only tested on debian-based platform unix distros. Prior to PlatRock installation, please check that the following dependencies are satisfied. 
        * python >= 3.6, which is the default on modern linux distros ;
        * [gdal](https://gdal.org/) (which can be installed on debian-based systems with `sudo apt install gdal-bin`).
        
        All other dependencies should be automatically installed by pip.
        
        # Installation
        After the prerequisites check, simply run
        > `pip3 install --upgrade platrock`
        
        You can also try the development version with (install git with `sudo apt install git` first) :
        > `pip3 install --upgrade git+https://gitlab.com/platrock/platrock.git@dev`
        
        # Examples
        Examples for all PlatRock simulation models are available on [PlatRock gitlab](https://gitlab.com/platrock/platrock/-/tree/master/examples).
         
        
        # Source code
        The source code of platrock is also available on the [gitlab repository](https://gitlab.com/platrock/platrock). The master branch fits the version that is hosted on pypi.
