    A Context exists to configure the SDK's behavior. The one setting that needs to be made in almost every instance is
    defining the tenant that should be made for subsequent requests. This Context is then passed in to create a
    service instance or a SplunkCloud instance:

    Example:
        client = SplunkCloud(Context(tenant="mytenant"), authManager)
        client.identity.validate()
