Python package to calculate "geologic entropy" and related metrics (e.g. entrogram, entropic scale, and local/global entropy values) quickly.

**NOTE:** Package still in alpha stages of development. This means that functionality and API are subject to change at any time. From v1.0.0 onwards the intent is for the package to be stable and have settled on an API scheme.

## Installation and Dependencies
`entrogrammer` is installable via `pip`:

```
pip install entrogrammer
```

To install from source, take the following steps:

- `git clone` the repository
- From your local copy of the repository run either `python setup.py install` to do a standard installation, or `pip install -e .` for an "editable" installation of the package

If you have issues installing the package via either method, check that you've got the dependencies installed. The dependencies for `entrogrammer` can be found in the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file.

## Introduction and Quickstart
In a nutshell, entropy quantifies the "surprise" content of some set of data. By this, we mean that if data are assigned probabilities and randomly drawn, entropy quantifies the "surprise" you'd encounter in the random drawing (no surprise if all data is identical, high amount of surprise if data is all different). For a more thorough description of entropy, we recommend starting with Claude Shannon's seminal paper on the subject [[1]](#1).

With `entrogrammer`, data can be classified into discrete categories, and entropy can be calculated at a variety of scales. This package is inspired by the works of Bianchi and Pedretti [[2](#2), [3](#3)] in which they related this idea of entropy to solute transport in porous media.

### API Structure
The gist of the API structure and usage for `entrogrammer` works as follows:

- Using some data, define a "classifier" object (`classifier.py`)
- Then apply the `classify()` method to classify the data into discrete categories or bins (if not automatically done when "classifier" is initialized)
- From `core.py` calculate the entropy statistic or metric you are interested in
- Then if you so choose, you can plot the computed statistic using one of the plotting methods in `plot.py`

### Quick Example

A quick example of calculating the entrogram of a small 1-D series of data ([0, 1, 0]) can be performed using `entrogrammer` with the following Python code:

```
import numpy as np
from entrogrammer import classifier, core
C = classifier.BinaryClassifier(np.array([0, 1, 0]), 0.5)  # binary classification of data
HR, win_size = core.calculate_entrogram(C)  # calculate the entrogram of this vector
```

From this point, the entrogram for this data could be plotted by making a plot of `HR` vs `win_size` to get a visual understanding of how the entropy varies at different scales. For a definition of the entrogram, some examples and an explanation of the metric, see [[3]](#3) and the [background](#background) section.

## Contributing Guidelines
Please report any issues or bugs you encounter with the package as an [Issue](https://github.com/elbeejay/entrogrammer/issues). Additionally, feel free to open an issue to discuss desired functionality, or potential contributions. If you've coded up an extension to `entrogrammer`, feel free to open up a [Pull Request](https://github.com/elbeejay/entrogrammer/pulls).

Note that this project tries to adhere to [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) code style conventions, and [PEP-257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) docstring conventions. Additionally, new code must have unit tests to check and verify that proposed functionality works as expected.

To run the unit tests locally, first ensure that you've cloned the repository and installed locally from source. Install `pytest` in your development environment (`pip install pytest`). Then from your local clone, just run `pytest` in the command line to run the suite of unit tests.
