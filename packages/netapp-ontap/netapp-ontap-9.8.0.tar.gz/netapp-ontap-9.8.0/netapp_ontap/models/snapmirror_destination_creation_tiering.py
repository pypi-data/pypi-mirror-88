This property is applicable to FlexVol volume, FlexGroup volume, and Consistency Group endpoints. This property determines whether the user data blocks of the destination endpoint in a FabricPool will be tiered to the cloud store when they become cold.

Temperature of the destination endpoint volume blocks increases if they are accessed frequently and decreases when they are not.<br>all &dash; This policy allows tiering of both destination endpoint Snapshot copies and the user transfered data blocks to the cloud store as soon as possible by ignoring the temperature on the volume blocks.

This property is applicable to FlexVol volume, FlexGroup volume, and Consistency Group endpoints. Only FabricPool aggregates are used if this property is set to "true" and only non FabricPool aggregates are used if this property is set to "false". Tiering support for a FlexGroup volume can be changed by moving all of the constituents to the required aggregates.
