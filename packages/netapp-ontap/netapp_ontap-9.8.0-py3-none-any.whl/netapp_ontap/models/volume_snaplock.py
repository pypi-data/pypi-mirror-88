The autocommit period value represents a duration and must be specified in the ISO-8601 duration format. The autocommit period can be in years, months, days, hours, and minutes. A period specified for years, months, and days is represented in the ISO-8601 format as "P<num>Y", "P<num>M", "P<num>D" respectively, for example "P10Y" represents a duration of 10 years. A duration in hours and minutes is represented by "PT<num>H" and "PT<num>M" respectively. The period string must contain only a single time element that is, either years, months, days, hours, or minutes. A duration which combines different periods is not supported, for example "P1Y10M" is not supported.
