# NetApp ONTAP
The Python client library is a package you can use when writing scripts to access the
ONTAP REST API. It provides support for several underlying services, including connection
management, asynchronous request processing, and exception handling. By using the Python
client library, you can quickly develop robust code to support the automation of your ONTAP
deployments.

# Getting started
The Python client library is available as the package **netapp_ontap** at the Python Package
Index (PyPi) web site at https://pypi.org/project/netapp-ontap

## Software requirements
Before installing the Python client library, you must make sure the following packages are
installed on your system:  

* python 3.5 or later    
* requests 2.21.0 or later   
* requests-toolbelt 0.9.1 or later
* marshmallow 3.2.1 or later  


## Installing and importing the package
You must install the package using the pip utility:

```
pip install netapp-ontap
```

After installing the package, you can import the objects you need into your application:

```python
from netapp_ontap.resources import Volume, Snapshot
```

## Creating an object

You can create an object in several different ways. Here are three examples of
creating an equivalent `Volume` object.

```python
from netapp_ontap.resources import Volume

# Example 1 - keyword arguments
volume = Volume(name='vol1', svm={'name': 'vs1'}, aggregates=[{'name': 'aggr1'}])

# Example 2 - dict as keyword arguments
data = {
    'name': 'vol1',
    'svm': {'name': 'vs1'},
    'aggregates': [{'name': 'aggr1'}],
}
volume = Volume(**data)

# Example 3 - using the from_dict() method
volume = Volume.from_dict({
    'name': 'vol1',
    'svm': {'name': 'vs1'},
    'aggregates': [{'name': 'aggr1'}],
})
```

## Performing actions on an object

After you create an object, you can perform actions on the object based
on the purpose and design of your application. The example below illustrates
how to create a new volume and then take a snapshot.

Note that when using the library, in all cases you must first establish a
connection to the management LIF of the ONTAP system using the
`netapp_ontap.host_connection.HostConnection` object. In the example below,
the connection is created and then set as the global default.
This means that all objects and the associated actions reuse
this same connection. See *Host connections* for more information.

```python
from netapp_ontap import config, HostConnection
from netapp_ontap.resources import Volume, Snapshot

config.CONNECTION = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com', 'username', 'password')

volume = Volume(name='vol1', svm={'name': 'vs1'}, aggregates=[{'name': 'aggr1'}])
volume.post()
snapshot = Snapshot.from_dict({
    'name': '%s_snapshot' % volume.name,
    'comment': 'A snapshot of %s' % volume.name,
    'volume': volume.to_dict(),
})
snapshot.post()
```

# Host connections

The `netapp_ontap.host_connection.HostConnection` object allows a client application
to store credentials once and reuse them for each subsequent operation.
You can do this in any of the following ways:

* Use the connection object as a context manager with the **with** keyword.

* Call the function `set_connection()` on a specific resource so the connection is used for
all actions on the resource.

* Set the `netapp_ontap.config.CONNECTION` variable to establish a single connection instance for all
operations within the scope of that block. This allows you to connect to ONTAP once
and use the same connection everywhere, instead of providing credentials every time you make a
request.

Note that you can call `get_connection()` to get the connection used by an object and use it for
subsequent operations.

By default, every operation attempts to verify the SSL certificate for the connection. If a
certificate cannot be verified, the **SSLError** exception is thrown. You can disable this
verification by setting `netapp_ontap.host_connection.HostConnection.verify` to false when creating the
`netapp_ontap.host_connection.HostConnection` instance.

## Custom headers

In some cases, you might want to set and send custom headers with the REST request.
This can be done at the connection level. For a specific connection, you can pass in
the headers you would like to send for each request within the scope of that connection object.
The library provides full access to the request headers so that you can update, add, or delete
headers from the same connection object at any point. If a header is not recognized by ONTAP,
it is ignored.

```python
from netapp_ontap import config, HostConnection
headers = {'my-header1':'my-header-value1', 'my-header2':'my-header-value2'}

# Initialize a connection object with custom headers
config.CONNECTION = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com', 'username', 'password', headers=headers)

# Delete a header from a connection object
conn = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com', 'username', 'password', headers=headers)
del conn.request_headers['my-header1']

# Add a header to a connection object using the assignment operator
conn = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com', 'username', 'password', headers=headers)
conn.request_headers['mynew-header'] = 'mynew-header-value'

# Add headers to a connection object
config.CONNECTION = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com', 'username' 'password')
config.CONNECTION.request_headers = headers

# Update an existing header using the assignment operator
config.CONNECTION = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com','username','password', headers=headers)
config.CONNECTION.request_headers['my-header1'] = 'my-new-header'
```

# Asynchronous processing and jobs

All POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests that can take more than two seconds to complete are
designed to run asynchronously as non-blocking operations. These operations are executed
as background jobs at the ONTAP cluster. The HTTP response generated by an
asynchronous request always contains a link to the associated job object. By default, an
asynchronous request automatically polls the job using the unique job identifier in the link.
Control is returned to your script when a terminal state is reached (success or failure) or
the configured timeout value expires. However, you can override this behavior by setting the
**poll** value to false when calling the function, causing control to return before the job
completes. Forcing an immediate return can be useful when a job might take a long time to
complete and you want to continute execution of the script.

# Responses

A request always returns a `netapp_ontap.response.NetAppResponse` object which contains the details
of the HTTP response. It contains information such as whether the response is an error
or a job. Refer to `netapp_ontap.response.NetAppResponse` for further information on how
to check the details of the response.

# Exception handling

By default, an exception is returned if a request returns an HTTP status code of 400 or greater.
The exception object, which is of type `netapp_ontap.error.NetAppRestError`,
holds the HTTP response object so that the exception can be handled in the client code.
If you wish not to raise exceptions, you can set `netapp_ontap.config.RAISE_API_ERRORS` to false. In this case,
it is up to the client to check the HTTP response from the `netapp_ontap.response.NetAppResponse`
object and handle any errors. Refer to `netapp_ontap.error.NetAppRestError` for further information.

```python
# Set RAISE_API_ERRORS to False and check the HTTP response.
config.RAISE_API_ERRORS = False
response = Svm.find(name="nonexistent_vs")
assert "entry doesn't exist" in response.http_response.text
```

# Debugging

While writing your application, it can often be useful to see the raw HTTP request and response
text that the library is sending to and from the server. There are two flags that can be set
to help with this.

## DEBUG flag

The first is the DEBUG flag. This can be set either by setting DEBUG=1 in the environment prior
to executing your application or by setting `netapp_ontap.utils.DEBUG` to 1 inside of your application.
This flag, when set, will cause the library to log the request and response for any failed
API call. This will be logged at DEBUG level (see the section on logging for setting up your
application). Here's an example of setting this value inside of your application:

```python
import logging

from netapp_ontap import HostConnection, NetAppRestError, config, utils
from netapp_ontap.resources import Volume

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
config.CONNECTION = HostConnection('10.100.200.50', username='admin', password='password', verify=False)

# Set the DEBUG flag to 1
utils.DEBUG = 1

# this API call will fail with a 404
try:
    volume = Volume(uuid="1", name='does_not_exist')
    volume.get()
except NetAppRestError:
    print('We got an expected exception')
```

Here is what the output would look like:

```
$ python test_debug.py

$
```

## LOG_ALL_API_CALLS flag

There is also a LOG_ALL_API_CALLS flag which can be set in the same ways. You can
set it in the environment or during script execution by setting `netapp_ontap.utils.LOG_ALL_API_CALLS`
to 1. This flag will produce the same output as above, but it will log the call no
matter if there was a failure or not. Here's an example of what that would look
like if we got an existing volume:

```python
import logging

from netapp_ontap import HostConnection, config, utils
from netapp_ontap.resources import Volume

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
config.CONNECTION = HostConnection('10.100.200.50', username='admin', password='password', verify=False)

# Set the LOG_ALL_API_CALLS flag to 1
utils.LOG_ALL_API_CALLS = 1

# this API call will succeed and be logged
volume = list(Volume.get_collection())[0]
```

Here is what the output would look like:

```

# Additional considerations

In most cases, the objects and actions in the library can be mapped directly
to equivalent cURL commands run against the ONTAP REST interface. However, there are a few
exceptions you should be aware of.

## Property names

If a property of a resource is named the same as one of the Python reserved names,
the name is transposed when accessing the member of the resource. For example,
if there is a resource named "Foo" that has a property defined in the API named "class",
the property name would instead be "class_" when using the library. For example:

```python
from netapp_ontap.resources import Foo

foo = Foo()
foo.class_ = "high"
```

Documentation of ONTAP's REST APIs and other helpful resources can be found at https://devnet.netapp.com/restapi.

# Compatibility

The version assigned to the library consists of the major ONTAP release it is generated
from and a minor version for the library within that release. For example: within the
ONTAP 9.7 product family, the library may ship several fix releases by incrementing the
minor index: 9.7.0, 9.7.1, 9.7.2. The minor version
allows the library to be updated at a cadence separate from ONTAP.

Client libraries that have the same major version as ONTAP are completely compatible.
For example, the libraries netapp-ontap-9.6.1 and netapp-ontap-9.6.4 are fully
compatible with both ONTAP 9.6 and ONTAP 9.6P1.

A client library will support N-1 major versions of ONTAP with full backwards compatiblity
of all APIs and fields. For example, a program written using client library 9.6.1 and
talking to ONTAP 9.6 will continue to function consistently when the client library is
updated to 9.7.0.

A client library with a major version less than the ONTAP release can still be
used, however it will not be able to access any of the new REST APIs. For example, the library
netapp-ontap-9.6.4 is only partially compatible with ONTAP 9.7. In this case, the library will
not have access to the newer APIs or fields offered by ONTAP, but scripts can continue to
access any of the same 9.6 fields they were before without issue.

For example a new property **volume.is_svm_root** was added with ONTAP 9.7.
The following behaviors would be seen with different libraries and ONTAP combinations:

* library 9.6.0 would ignore the value coming from an ONTAP 9.7 response

* library 9.7.0 would fully support the property coming from an ONTAP 9.7+ response

* library 9.7.0 would not produce any errors fro that property coming from an ONTAP 9.6 response

# Changelog

## 9.7.3 library updates  
(2020-07-21)

**Fixed issues**

* [Bug ID 1322090](https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1322090)  
  When polling jobs, the certificate verification setting was hard-coded to False, so it would behave the same regardless of how the user set it.

* [Bug ID 1322095](https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1322095) 
  The get_collection() call using the connection parameter was not correctly setting the connection on the returned resource objects.


## 9.7.1 library updates  
(2020-04-06)

**New**

* A `count_collection()` method is now available on all resources which have a `get_collection()`. This method is a shortcut for getting only the number of items matching a query. For example: `Volume.count_collection(name="backup_vol*")` is roughly equivalent to `len(list(Volume.get_collection(name="backup_vol*")))`.

## 9.7.0 GA library updates  
(2020-01-23)

**Fixed issues**

* [Bug ID 1279507](https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1279507)  
  When doing a find() with the fields query parameter, the library was not returning the specified fields, instead, all fields were being returned.

* [Bug ID 1291333](https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1291333)  
  When 0 records are found in a Resource.find() call and LOG_ALL_API_CALLS is set to True, then an uncaught exception is raised.


## 9.7.0 RC1 library updates  
(2019-11-20)

**New**

* The application can now add its own custom headers for each request as part of the `netapp_ontap.host_connection.HostConnection` object.
* When passing verify=False to the HostConnection, the library will now disable urllib3's InsecureRequestWarning from logging messages.

**Incompatibilities**

* In prior versions, Resource.find() would raise an exception if no results were found as well as when more than one was found. In this version, when no results are found, None is returned instead of raising an exception. An exception is still raised when more than one result is found.

**Fixed issues**

* [Bug ID 1271450](https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1271450)  
  The library doesn't allow sending a body in a DELETE request.

* [Bug ID 1263312](https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1263312)  
  When POSTing or PATCHing some objects with embeded objects, fields might incorrectly be dropped from the request.

* [Bug ID 1275238](https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1275238)  
  Retrieving and setting the "from" field of Autosupport object fails.

##ONTAP 9.7 REST API updates

All new ONTAP APIs have corresponding library resource objects which can be used
to perform the operations. See the `netapp_ontap.resources` package for details
about each of the objects and their fields.

For a summary of the changes in the ONTAP REST API between versions of ONTAP 9, see the [ONTAP 9 Release Notes](https://library.netapp.com/ecmdocs/ECMLP2492508/html/frameset.html).
