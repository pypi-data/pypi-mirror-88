Description: ## Get-Url-Status (GUS) Text-As-Visual-Output (TAVO)
        GUS is a command line tool that searches a file for all HTTP URLs and generates a report of their status.
        ### Usage
        ```
        $ python gus [-f FILENAME]
        ```
        Optional command line arguments | Description
        --|--
        -f FILENAME, --file FILENAME | location of source file to be checked
        -t, --telescope | check recent posts indexed by Telescope
        -a, --all | output includes all results (this is default)
        -g, --good | output includes only [GOOD] results
        -b, --bad | output includes only [FAIL] results
        -r, --rtf | output as colourized rich text file
        -j, --json | output as JSON
        -h, --help | show information on how to use the tool and exit
        -v, --version | show program's version number and exit
        -i FILENAME, --ignore FILENAME | location of file with list of domains to ignore
        ### Results
        GUS makes an HTTP connection for each URL in the source file.\
        The header is requested and the response code determines which label will be applied:
        * [GOOD] = 2xx series
        * [FAIL] = 4xx series 
        * [UNKN] = all other code series
        
        GUS can generate **output.rft** as a list of results colourized as follows:
        * [GOOD] = green 
        * [FAIL] = red
        * [UNKN] = grey
