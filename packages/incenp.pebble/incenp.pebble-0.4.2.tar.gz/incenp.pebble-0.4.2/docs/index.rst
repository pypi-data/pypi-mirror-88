Pebble Manual
=============

Pebble is a command-line client for the `Passman`_ passwords manager for
`Nextcloud`_. It allows users to view and edit the contents of a
Passman vault from the command line and with their favorite text editor
rather than from a web browser.

Pebble is free software, published under the GNU General Public License.
It is written in Python and should work with both Python 2.7 and Python
3.5+.
