Module that contains Persistent Message Publisher.

A Persistent Message Publisher must be created by
:py:class:`solace.messaging.builder.persistent_message_publisher_builder.PersistentMessagePublisherBuilder`. The
``PersistentMessagePublisher`` instance is used to publish Guaranteed Messages created by a
:py:class:`solace.messaging.publisher.outbound_message.OutboundMessageBuilder`. The
Topic (or destination) can be added once the message is a published.

The persistent message publisher can also be used to publish simple messages containing only a bytearray or
string payload.

    A class that defines the interface to a publisher for persistent messages.

    NOTE:
        The ``DeliveryReceipt`` is available asynchronously via
        :py:class:`solace.messaging.publisher.persistent_message_publisher.MessageDeliverListener`.
        Message correlation tokens are used to DeliveryReceipt.

    Alternatively, applications can get delivery confirmation by publishing with the synchronous method
    :py:meth:`PersistentMessagePublisher.publish_await_acknowledgement()` method that does
    not return until the published message has been acknowledged by the PubSub+ event broker.
