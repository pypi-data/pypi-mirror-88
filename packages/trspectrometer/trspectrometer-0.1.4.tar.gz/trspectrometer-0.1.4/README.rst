TRSpectrometer
==============

This software package allows the collection, viewing, and analysis of time-resolved (TR) spectroscopy data.

    **Warning**: The application is under heavy development and is currently in an early, incomplete state.
    Features and documentation are lacking.
    Appearance, functionality and file formats may change at any time.
    Malfunctions may occur which kill your pets.

    Regardless, the application is still functional and provides useful features.
    It is released with the hope it is useful, but comes with no warranty.
