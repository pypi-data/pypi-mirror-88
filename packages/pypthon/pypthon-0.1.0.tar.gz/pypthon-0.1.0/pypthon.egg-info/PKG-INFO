Description: # Pypthon
        
        Pipes for python3 to be used in shell
        
        # Setup
        
        ```
        pip install -U pypthon
        ```
        
        # Usage
        
        ```
        pyp 'Pypthon command'
        ```
        
        A Pypthon command consists of the following
        
        ```
        source | piped function | piped function | piped function
        ```
        
        The source must be any python expression. To have the source be another command being piped into Pypthon, use ``stdin``.
        
        ## Piped functions
        
        Piped functions are any python functions which take the previous value as their last argument. In the example,
        
        ```python
        [2, 1, 3] | sorted | print "Sorted" "list:"
        ```
        
        ``sorted`` takes in the iterable ``[2, 1, 3]`` as its last parameter and ``print`` takes the sorted list as its last parameter. When passing other arguments to functions in Pypthon, one must use the space separated syntax. In our example, the strings ``"Sorted"`` and ``"list:"`` are passed as arguments to ``print`` via the syntax of separating each argument with a space.
        
        ```
        Sorted list: [1, 2, 3]
        ```
        
        will be outputted by the above command.
        
        ## Lambda expressions
        
        In python, lambdas are of the following structure
        
        ```python
        lambda arg1, arg2: arg1 + arg2
        ```
        
        In pypthon, lambda expressions do not need the ``lambda`` keyword before the arguments. In the example,
        
        ```python
        ['1.', '6.', '2.', '4.'] | map x: int(float(x)) | reduce x, y: x if x > y else y | print
        ```
        
        ``map`` converts the strings in the list into integers, and ``reduce`` finds the maximum of the integers.
        
        ## Environment
        
        ```python
        # TODO documentation, for now just look in pypthon/environment.py
        ```
        
        # Other
        
        This project idea was heavily inspired by the pied piper package which only works with Python 2 and has virtually disappeared.
