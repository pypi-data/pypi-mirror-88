# The functionality in transform_nc_to_nm.py and vib_analysis.py to various extents replicates or was 
# written on the basis of (or inspired by) corresponding functionality in the Dalton quantum chemistry
# program (Copyright (C) 2018 by the authors of Dalton) and unreleased code associated with Dalton/OpenRSP. # In the released Dalton program, the source code files containing this functionality are 
# DALTON/abacus/abavib.F and DALTON/abacus/hergp.F. An overview of the routines in the current module
# transform_nc_to_nm for which this applies and the routines in Dalton from which the functionality was
# replicated, based upon or inspired by, is as follows:

# Routine in transform_nc_to_nm.py              Corresponding routine(s)
