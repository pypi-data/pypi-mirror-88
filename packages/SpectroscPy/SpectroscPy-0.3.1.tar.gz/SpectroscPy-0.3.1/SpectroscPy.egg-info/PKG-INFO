        This package is created to postprocess the tensors resulting from an OpenRSP properties calculation.
        It is especially aimed at vibrational properties, such as IR and Raman.
        It will do
        
            1) Read the tensors and unpack them into (non-non)redundant (many-dimensional)matrices
            2) Hessian eigen-analysis to find normal modes and frequencies
            3) Transform all other property-matrices to normal coordinates
            4) Calculate intensities
            5) Plot spectra

        Dalton legacy:
        The functionality in transform_nc_to_nm.py and vib_analysis.py to various extents replicates or was written on the basis of (or inspired by) corresponding functionality in the Dalton quantum chemistry program (Copyright (C) 2018 by the authors of Dalton) and unreleased code associated with Dalton/OpenRSP. In the released Dalton program, the source code files containing this functionality are DALTON/abacus/abavib.F and DALTON/abacus/hergp.F. An overview of the routines in these two scripts for which this applies and the routines in Dalton from which the functionality was replicated, based upon or inspired by, can be found in our source codes transform_nc_to_nm.py and vib_analysis.py.
