# samspecialfuncs

An assortment of functions that are useful in my research, which are usually
defined via chebyshev polynomials.

Here is a list of the defined functions...

in the bristol integrals folder ``samspecialfunc.bristol.integrals``

.. math::
   
   \gamma_{12} = \int_{0.5}^x I_1(u)/u^{12} du
   \gamma_{6} = \int_{0.5}^x I_1(u)/u^{6} du
   \kappa_{12} = \int_{0.5}^x K_1(u)/u^{12} du
   \kappa_{6} = \int_{0.5}^x K_1(u)/u^{6} du


where :math:`I_1` and :math:`K_1` are first order modified bessel functions of the first
and second kinds, respectively.
