Description: # samspecialfuncs
        
        An assortment of functions that are useful in my research, which are usually
        defined via chebyshev polynomials.
        
        Here is a list of the defined functions...
        
        in the bristol integrals folder ``samspecialfunc.bristol.integrals``
        
        .. math::
           
           \gamma_{12} = \int_{0.5}^x I_1(u)/u^{12} du
           \gamma_{6} = \int_{0.5}^x I_1(u)/u^{6} du
           \kappa_{12} = \int_{0.5}^x K_1(u)/u^{12} du
           \kappa_{6} = \int_{0.5}^x K_1(u)/u^{6} du
        
        
        where :math:`I_1` and :math:`K_1` are first order modified bessel functions of the first
        and second kinds, respectively.
