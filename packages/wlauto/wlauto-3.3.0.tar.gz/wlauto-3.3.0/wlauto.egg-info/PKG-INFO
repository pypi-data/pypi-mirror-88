Description: Workload Automation
        +++++++++++++++++++
        
        Workload Automation (WA) is a framework for executing workloads and collecting
        measurements on Android and Linux devices. WA includes automation for nearly 40
        workloads and supports some common instrumentation (ftrace, hwmon) along with a
        number of output formats.
        
        WA is designed primarily as a developer tool/framework to facilitate data driven
        development by providing a method of collecting measurements from a device in a
        repeatable way.
        
        WA is highly extensible. Most of the concrete functionality is implemented via
        plug-ins, and it is easy to write new plug-ins to support new device types,
        workloads, instruments or output processing.
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        - Python 3.5+
        - Linux (should work on other Unixes, but untested)
        - Latest Android SDK (ANDROID_HOME must be set) for Android devices, or
        - SSH for Linux devices
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install::
        
                git clone git@github.com:ARM-software/workload-automation.git workload-automation
                sudo -H python setup [install|develop]
        
        Note: A `requirements.txt` is included however this is designed to be used as a
        reference for known working versions rather than as part of a standard
        installation.
        
        Please refer to the `installation section <http://workload-automation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_information.html#install>`_
        in the documentation for more details.
