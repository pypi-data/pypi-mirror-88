        Create python wrappers that call c functions, without the headaches.
        
        In a nutshell:
        
        ```python
        from c2py import dispatch
        m = dispatch(
            src,  # specification of the C sources (poiting to specific C functions)
        	convention,  # optional convention of wrapping rules
        	**configs  # specific configuration (for wrapping rules that are not covered by convention, or need to be overwritten)
        )
        
        m.python_wrapper_to_c_func(...)  # now m is a module containing python wrappers to the desired c functions
        ```
        
        Other forms:
        ```python
        dispatch_to_file(src, target_filepath, ...)  # to get output as a persisted .py file
        ```
        
        To install:	```pip install c2py```
