# PySubmarine
PySubmarine is aiming to ease the ML engineer's life by providing a set of libraries.

It includes a high-level out-of-box ML library like deepFM, FM, etc.
low-level library to interact with submarine like creating experiment,
tracking experiment metrics, parameters.


## Package setup
- Install latest version of pysubmarine
```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/submarine.git
cd submarine/submarine-sdk/pysubmarine
pip install .
```
- Install package from pypi
```bash
pip install apache-submarine
```

## Easy-to-use model trainers
- [FM](https://github.com/apache/submarine/tree/master/submarine-sdk/pysubmarine/example/tensorflow/fm)
- [DeepFM](https://github.com/apache/submarine/tree/master/submarine-sdk/pysubmarine/example/tensorflow/deepfm)

## Submarine experiment management
Makes it easy to run distributed or non-distributed TensorFlow, PyTorch experiments on Kubernetes.
- [mnist example](https://github.com/apache/submarine/tree/master/submarine-sdk/pysubmarine/example/submarine_experiment_sdk.ipynb)

## Development
See [Python Development](https://github.com/apache/submarine/tree/master/docs/submarine-sdk/pysubmarine/development.md) in the documentation subproject.
