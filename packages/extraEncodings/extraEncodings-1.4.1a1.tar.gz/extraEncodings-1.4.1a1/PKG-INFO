Description: # Extra encodings for Python 
        
        ## Update 1.4
        ---
        Changed my license.
        Added Gui with tkinter (Please have tkinter or the whole thing won't work)\
        Finshed ichor\
        Added a class for a 2 way dict in classsstuff.py so check that out\
        Killed my brain\
        Decided not to release a version every week and now every month.
        Decided to delete encodingsbeta and will make  a beta version package (Coming January)
        
        ## Update 1.3.2
        ----
        Gen2 and LTF64 released for beta and ichor has progressed for US keyboard.\
        Updated import process for beta for technical reasons\
        Added support for Python 3.6\
        
        
        ## Plans:
        ----
        Add a function that makes a encoding\
        Add a github project\
        Adding more encodings/decodings\
        Make my TwoWayDict class more feature rich.\
        Add Binary encodings
        
        
        ## Notes
        ----
        This is my first ever package (Which noone has ever installed)\
        Ichor is not available in GUI due to python dictionarys being stubborn\
        Currently we only support all characters on a US keyboard for all encoding types and a computer that runs a standard os like Win32/64 , macOS (Not tested), Linux Debian,Ubuntu and distros based on them.
        
        ## Planned and Implmented Decodings and encodings:
        ----
        Ichor\
        Gen2\
        LTF-64\
        GTX2\
        BIN10(future update)
        
        ## How to import
        ----
        ```
            import extra_Encodings.extra_Encodings_pkg as ExtraEncodings
             from ExtraEncodings import * 
        ```
