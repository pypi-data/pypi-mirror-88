        Pytest fixtures for Invenio.
        
        The package offers a number of features to help test Invenio based
        applications:
        
        - Less boilerplate: Using the fixtures you can keep your ``conftest.py`` short
          and focused.
        - Database re-use: database tests are running inside a transaction which is
          rolled back after the test.
        - End-to-end testing: Selenium tests can easily be switched on/off, and in case
          of test failures a screenshot is taken (with possibility to output in the
          console in base64-encoding - useful on e.g. TravisCI).
        - Application configuration for testing (e.g. disable CSRF protection in forms
          and HTTPS requirement).
        - JSON decoding support in Flask test client for easier API testing.
        - Batteries included: further fixtures help with e.g. mail sending and CLI
          tests.
        
        Further documentation is available on https://pytest-invenio.readthedocs.io/.

        Changes
        =======
        
        Version 1.4.1 (released 2020-12-17)
        
        - Remove pytest-celery because it's still an alpha release.
        
        Version 1.4.0 (released 2020-09-16)
        
        - BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE: Changes to use isort, pycodestyle and pydocstyle via
          pytest plugins. You need to update `pytest.ini` and remove the ``--pep8``
          from the addopts and instead add ``--isort --pydocstyle --pycodestyle``:
        
          .. code-block:: ini
        
              addopts = --isort --pydocstyle --pycodestyle ...
        
          In `./run-tests.sh` script you should also remove calls to pydocstyle and
          isort as both are now integrated with pytest.
        
        - BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE: Upgrade dependencies: coverage, pytest-flask,
          check-manifest, pytest. You need to set the pytest-flask live server
          fixture scope in your pytest config:
        
          .. code-block:: ini
        
             [pytest]
             live_server_scope = function
        
        - Decommission pytest-pep8 (last release in 2014) in favour of pycodestyle.
        
        Version 1.3.4 (released 2020-09-15)
        
        - Add `entrypoints` fixture to allow injecting extra entry points during
          testing so that you avoid manual registration of e.g. mappings and schemas.
        
        Version 1.3.3 (released 2020-08-27)
        
        - Add `docker-services-cli` as dependency to enable Invenio modules to
          perform reproducible tests.
        
        Version 1.3.2 (released 2020-05-19)
        
        - Move check-manifest, coverage, isort, pydocstyle, pytest-flask and
          pytest-pep8 from test to install requirements to provide them as centrally
          managed dependencies.
        
        Version 1.3.1 (released 2020-05-12)
        
        - Uninstalls numpy in Travis due to incompatibilities with
          elasticsearch-py.
        
        Version 1.3.0 (released 2020-03-19)
        
        - Removes support for Python 2.7.
        
        Version 1.2.2 (released 2020-05-07)
        
        - Uninstalls numpy in Travis due to incompatibilities with
          elasticsearch-py.
        - Deprecated Python versions lower than 3.6.0. Now supporting 3.6.0.
        - Set maximum version of Werkzeug to 1.0.0 due to incompatible imports.
        - Set maximum version of Flask to 1.1.0 due to incompatible imports.
        - Set maximum version of Pytest-Flask to 1.0.0 due to breaking changes.
        - Set minimum version of Invenio-Search to 1.2.3 and maximum to 1.3.0.
        
        Version 1.2.1 (released 2019-11-13)
        
        - Fixes instance path fixture to also set the static folder.
        
        Version 1.2.0 (released 2019-07-31)
        
        - Adds fixture for creating default Location.
        - Adds fixture for creating Bucket from directory with files.
        
        Version 1.1.1 (released 2019-05-21)
        
        - Adds pytest-cov as install dependency.
        
        Version 1.1.0 (released 2019-02-15)
        
        - Changes name of fixture from celery_config to celery_config_ext due to
          unreliable overwriting of celery_config fixture name.
        
        Version 1.0.6 (released 2018-12-03)
        
        - Fixes overwriting of celery_config fixture
        
        Version 1.0.5 (released 2018-10-08)
        
        - Adds default Content Security Policy header to the app configuration.
        - Fixes issue with default tests scope.
        
        Version 1.0.4 (released 2018-08-14)
        
        - Bumps pytest minimun version to 3.8.0.
        
        Version 1.0.3 (released 2018-09-05)
        
        - Moves module dependent imports inside the fixture functions in order to
          decouple dependencies for Invenio apps or modules that might not be using
          them.
        
        Version 1.0.2 (released 2018-05-25)
        
        Version 1.0.1 (released 2018-04-17)
        
        Version 1.0.0 (released 2018-03-22)
