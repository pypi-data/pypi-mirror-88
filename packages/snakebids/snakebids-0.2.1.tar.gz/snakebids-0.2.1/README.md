Snakemake + BIDS

This package allows you to build BIDS Apps using Snakemake. It offers:

 * Flexible data grabbing with PyBIDS, configurable solely by config file entries
 * Helper function for creating BIDS paths inside Snakemake workflows/rules
 * Command-line invocation of snakemake workflows with BIDS App compliance
 * Configurable argument parsing specified using the Snakemake workflow config
 * Execution either as command-line BIDS apps or via snakemake executable

See the example template BIDS app in the `template_app` subfolder for an example of usage.

Documentation under construction.
