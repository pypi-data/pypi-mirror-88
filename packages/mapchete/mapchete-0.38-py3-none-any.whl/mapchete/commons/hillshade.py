    """
    Calculate slope and aspect map.

    Return a pair of arrays 2 pixels smaller than the input elevation array.

    Slope is returned in radians, from 0 for sheer face to pi/2 for
    flat ground. Aspect is returned in radians, counterclockwise from -pi
    at north around to pi.

    Logic here is borrowed from hillshade.cpp:
    http://www.perrygeo.net/wordpress/?p=7

    Parameters
    ----------
    elevation : array

    yres : float
        row  height

    scale : float
        scale factor of pixel size units versus height units (insert 112000
