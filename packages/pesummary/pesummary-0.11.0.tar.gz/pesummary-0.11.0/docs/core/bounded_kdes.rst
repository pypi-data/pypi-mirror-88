============
Bounded KDEs
============

In many situations, we may have a set of samples which are bounded by a given
domain. For this case, the standard
`scipy.stats.gaussian_kde <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.gaussian_kde.html>`_
will not accurately capture the true shape of the distribution. For cases like
this, we require a bounded KDE.

There are a number of ways to take into account the bounded nature of the
distribution. The common methods include treating the boundary as being
reflective, meaning that the derivative on the boundary is 0, and transforming
to new coordinates where your PDF does not have a boundary and looks reasonably
Gaussian, since then the `scipy.stats.gaussian_kde` will have an easier time
representing it.

`pesummary` handles bounded KDEs through the `pesummary.core.plots.bounded_1d_kde`
module. Below is an example which shows a distribution which is bounded in the
domain `0 < x < 1`. We show how each method handles the boundary:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from pesummary.core.plots.bounded_1d_kde import bounded_1d_kde
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> rands = np.random.random_sample(10000)
    >>> transf = 0.5 + np.arcsin(2. * rands - 1.) / np.pi
    >>> fig = plt.figure()
    >>> plt.hist(transf, bins=50, density=True, histtype="step")
    >>> xsmooth = np.linspace(0., 1., 100)
    >>> unbounded_kde = stats.gaussian_kde(transf)
    >>> reflection = bounded_1d_kde(transf, xlow=0., xhigh=1., method="Reflection")
    >>> transform = bounded_1d_kde(transf, xlow=0., xhigh=1., method="Transform", smooth=2)
    >>> plt.plot(xsmooth, unbounded_kde(xsmooth), label="gaussiankde")
    >>> plt.plot(xsmooth, reflection(xsmooth), label="reflection")
    >>> plt.plot(*transform(xsmooth), label="transform")
    >>> plt.ylabel("Probability Density")
    >>> plt.legend()
    >>> plt.show()

Of course, different techniques for handling the boundaries are useful in
different situations. Clearly, the `transform` method is best for the example
above. Below we show an example where the `reflection` method is best:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> xsmooth = np.linspace(0., 1., 100)
    >>> pts = np.random.uniform(0, 1, 10000)
    >>> fig = plt.figure()
    >>> plt.hist(pts, bins=50, density=True, histtype="step")
    >>> unbounded_kde = stats.gaussian_kde(pts)
    >>> reflection = bounded_1d_kde(pts, xlow=0., xhigh=1., method="Reflection")
    >>> transform = bounded_1d_kde(pts, xlow=0., xhigh=1., method="Transform", smooth=6)
    >>> plt.plot(xsmooth, unbounded_kde(xsmooth), label="gaussiankde")
    >>> plt.plot(xsmooth, reflection(xsmooth), label="reflection")
    >>> plt.plot(*transform(xsmooth), label="transform")
    >>> plt.ylabel("Probability Density")
    >>> plt.legend()
    >>> plt.show()
