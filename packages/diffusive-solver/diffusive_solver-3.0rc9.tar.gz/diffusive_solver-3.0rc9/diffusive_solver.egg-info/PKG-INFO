Description: # Diffusive_solver (version 3.0)
        
        Package for solving systems of coupled diffusion equations in a device setup using Finite
        Element Method (FEM).
        The package is based on [FeniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) FEM project.
        
        A rigorous formulation of the mathematical problem and a description of the basic functionalities can be found in https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04351.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Diffusive_solver requires FEniCS. Please refer to the FEniCS [installation
        page](https://fenicsproject.org/download/).
        
        After installing FEniCS diffusive_solver can be obtained via pip
        
            pip install diffusive-solver
        
        or downloaded from the project [repository](https://gitlab.com/itorre/diffusive_solver).
        
        ## Examples
        
        Please refer to the project [repository](https://gitlab.com/itorre/diffusive_solver/tests) for example notebooks.
