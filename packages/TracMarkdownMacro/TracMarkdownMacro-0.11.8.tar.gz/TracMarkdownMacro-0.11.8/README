= Markdown !WikiProcessor Macro Implementation =

== Description ==

The !MarkdownMacro package implements John Gruber's [http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ Markdown]
lightweight plain text-to-HTML formatting syntax as a [WikiProcessors WikiProcessor] macro. The original
code is courtesy of Alex Mizrahi aka [#SeeAlso killer_storm]. I simply added a little robustness to the error 
checking, documented the package, created setup.py and this README, and registered it with
[MarkdownMacro Trac Hacks].
