"""This module contains TensorFlow-based peak finding methods.

In general, the inputs to the functions provided here operate on confidence maps
(sometimes referred to as heatmaps), which are image-based representations of the
locations of landmark coordinates.

In these representations, landmark locations are encoded as probability that it is
present each pixel. This is often represented by an unnormalized 2D Gaussian PDF
centered at the true location and evaluated over the entire image grid.

Peak finding entails finding either the global or local maxima of these confidence maps.
