    This is a useful function for creating the x- and y-vectors that define a sampling
    grid over an image space. These vectors can be used to generate a full meshgrid or
    for equivalent broadcasting operations.

    Args:

            scalar integer.

            scalar integer.
        output_stride: Sampling step size, specified as a scalar integer. This can be
            used to specify a sampling grid that has a smaller shape than the image
            grid but with values span the same range. This can be thought of as the
            reciprocal of the output scale, i.e., it will induce subsampling when set to
            values greater than 1.

    Returns:
