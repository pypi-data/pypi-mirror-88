""" This is a sphinx extension for generating API reST docs. I tried sphinx automodapi extension,
    see https://sphinx-automodapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/, but there's just not enough customization options
    to give me the result I want.

    This file takes same approach as automodapi, where it reads in a package and generates reST files with
    autodoc markup in them. It defers to autodoc for actually generating the doc pages. Advantage of having
    this small, lightweight extension is you can easily customize the generated output

    Keep it simple, stupid

    kissapi_config = {
        out_dir: (str, def="kissapi_output") output directory for files generated by renderer
        overwrite: (bool or "partial", def=True), whether to overwrite the out_dir:
            - True = delete folder and completely rebuild
            - "partial" = allow files to be overwritten, but don't delete out_dir initially
            - False = don't do anything if folder is found, keep as is
        jinja_dir: a directory with jinja templates, which allows you to use some helpers on KissAPI
            instance for easier reST file generation; if a relative path is given, it will be relative to the root docs
            folder. By default, this is set to ``kissapi.templates`` directory, which are some default jinja templates
            I have made to go along with :meth:`~kissapi.render.package_template`
        jinja_env: jinja environment will be created from jinja_dir, but you can manually create one
            instead if you desire and set it to this config option
        output: {
            [name]: {
                package: the package to be introspected (see "introspect" config val to customize), and rendered
                render: a callback with signature (RenderManager, PackageAPI); it can use the RenderManager instance
                    to generate other reST files; return any text you wish to insert in-place of the directive. By
                    default, :meth:`~def_render.package_template` will be used if not specified.
            }
        }
        # Options for customizing the introspection behavior for packages to be rendered
        introspect: {
            [pkgname]: {
                package_exclude: callback(pkg_name:str, module_name:str) -> bool; return True if the module
                    (from sys.modules) should be excluded from the package given by pkg_name. By default, this is
                    PackageAPI.package_exclude, which excludes modules not prefixed by "[pkg_name].", or that contain
                    a private module ("_" prefix somewhere in path). Only non-exluded modules are analyzed.
                var_exclude: callback(pkg_name:str, var:VariableValueAPI) -> bool; return True if the variable
                    should be excluded from ModuleAPI's vars/aliased_vars/exports lists. By default this is
                    PackageAPI.var_exclude, which excludes private and external variables (see var.is_private/is_external
                    methods)
            }
        }
    }

    To inject rendered output into existing reST files, include the directive:

    .. kissapi:: [output_name]

    TODO: Helper API methods:
        - undocumented, check if __doc__ is non-empty
        - autodetect overridden methods, like __init__
        - detect :private: in doc string to exclude private stuff
        - "external" flag on VariableTypes.MODULE, if it isn't one of package modules
