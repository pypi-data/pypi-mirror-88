        ## History
        
        Between 1984 and 2986, A. J. Sierk developped the `BARFIT` (also refered as `fisbar`) routine to compute fission barrier, ground state energy and maximum angular momentum a nucleus can sustain in the framework of the liquid drop model. 
        
        The routine used fitted value over a wide range of A, Z and L. 
        In fact, it is an impressive piece of code that performs a global fit, where we would use today some kind of machine learning model.
        The full calculation and routine is described in [*A. Sierk, Phys. Rev. C33 (1986) 2039.*](https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.33.2039).
        
        
        The [routine](https://www-nds.iaea.org/RIPL-3/fission/fis-barrier-liquiddrop.for) is still available today from the [RIPL-3 website](https://www-nds.iaea.org/RIPL-3/) ([Readme of original routine](https://www-nds.iaea.org/RIPL-3/fission/fis-barrier-liquiddrop.readme)).
        
        ## Python implementation
        
        The 1986 Fortran routine is old and may not compile on modern computers. However, the routine is still of great interest, as it is able to provide an estimate for a fission barrier for light elements (For heavy ones, one can find the predicted values by P.&nbsp;Moeller, A.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Sierk, *et&nbsp;al* : "**[HEAVY-ELEMENT FISSION BARRIERS](https://t2.lanl.gov/nis/molleretal/publications/PRCFIS-2009.html)**").
        
        The code of is quite straightforward, so it's not too hard to translate it into python. 
        
        This is one implementation in python 3.6. The code is almost a line-for-line translation of the original fortran routine. As is, it is quite un-pythonic, but it makes the working, testing and checking easier when writing from the orginal code.
        
        The `lpoly` routine of Sierk was replaced with the `numpy.polynomial.legendre` module to obtain the legendre polynomial values. (This is the only external dependency of the module).
        
        ### Accuracy
        
        The output of the code is compared to the references values given by A. Sierk in the [original Fortran file](https://www-nds.iaea.org/RIPL-3/fission/fis-barrier-liquiddrop.for). 
        The python module was tested against theses values : 
        
        |   |   |   |      A. Sierk's reference values       ||| Python Implementation results       || |
        |---|---|---|:--------:|:---:|:----:|:---------------------:|:---:|:----:|
        | Z | A | L | B_f     | Egs | Lmax | Bf    | Egs | Lmax | 
        |   |   |   |           |          |           |          |           |          |
        | 28 | 58 | 0 | 33.14   | 0.0 | 46.1 | 33.14    | 0.00 | 46.13 |
        | 28 | 58 | 25 | 19.5   | 21.36 | 46.1 | 18.52    | 20.00 | 46.13 |
        | 28 | 58 | 40 | 2.97   | 49.66 | 46.1 | 2.47    | 31.18 | 46.13 |
        | 28 | 58 | 46.1 | 0   | 59.14 | 46.1 | 0.00    | 58.56 | 46.13 |
        |   |   |   |           |          |           |          |           |          |
        | 65 | 153 | 0 | 28.88   | 0.0 | 82.3 | 28.88    | 0.00 | 82.27 |
        | 65 | 153 | 50 | 16.16   | 19.0 | 82.3 | 14.16    | 19.80 | 82.27 |
        | 65 | 153 | 80 | 0.26   | 45.24 | 82.3 | 0.12    | 31.47 | 82.27 |
        | 65 | 153 | 82.3 | 0.0   | 47.01 | 82.3 | 0.00    | 47.29 | 82.27 | 
        |   |   |   |           |          |           |          |           |          |
        | 93 | 229 | 0 | 3.76   | 0.0 | 68.1 | 3.76    | 0.00 | 68.13 |
        | 93 | 229 | 45 | 1.26   | 8.21 | 68.1 | 1.22    | 9.12 | 68.13 |
        | 93 | 229 | 68.1 | 0.0   | 17.96 | 68.1 | 0.00    | 17.83 | 68.13 |
        
        ⚠ We notice significant differences. This is probably due to floating point precision between today's python and the Fortran used by A. Sierk to perform the fits in 1986. Therefore, the values should be not be taken at face value, but they are a good first approximation.

        An online [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/git/https%3A%2F%2Fgitlab.in2p3.fr%2Fgregoire.henning%2Ffisbar-pytho/HEAD) notebook has been created to allow the execution of the code online.
        via binder.
        
        ### Running Locally
        
        You can also install and run the routine on your local computer
        
        #### Installation
        
        ##### Via pip
        
        The prefered way of installing the library is via `pip` by running the following command:
        
        ```shell
        $ pip install fisbar
        ```
        
        
        ##### via `setup.py`
        
        Installation can be perfomed using the [dist/fisbar-20201120.tar.gz]() archive, that contain the module installation files, to be installed via :
        ```shell
        $ python setup.py
        ```
        
        #### Running
        
        ##### As a standalone program
        
        Usage:
        
        ```shell
        $ python -m fisbar [-h] [--style {columns,human,dict,yaml}] Z A [L]
        ```
        
        This runs the module at stand alone program. 
        
        Arguments are `Z`, `A` (both mandatory), `L` (default = 0) and output style.
        
        The style can be `columns`, `human`, `dict` (default) or `yaml`. 
        When using `columns` output style, the results are outputed as columns following : `Z A L bfis Egs Lmax`.
        `human` outputs the results in a readable format. `yaml` as a Yaml formated dictionnary and `dict` as a python dictionnary (also compatible with json). When a value is not computed (because the code failed), it appears either as 0 or `***`.
        
        
        ##### As a python module
        
        The `fisbar` routine can be used in a python code by importing it inside your program. For example
        
        ```python
        import fisbar
        
        Z = 92
        A = 238
        L = 0
        
        print(fisbar,fisbar(Z, A, L))
        ```
        
        will output 
        > {}
        > ### example
