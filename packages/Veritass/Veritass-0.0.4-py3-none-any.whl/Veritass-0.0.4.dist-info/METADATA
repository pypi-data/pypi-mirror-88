# Veritas
(Package name is Veritass due to namespace problems)
Veritas is an opensource fact checking tool.
It will be able to check a statment with the help of the Semantic Web, by converting text into sparql querry questions which will then be passed into a KnowledgeGraph.


## TODO:
1. Getting an input (e.g. tweet, article etc.) -> Done
2. Converting the input into questions -> Work in progress
3. Converting the questions into a Sparql query (using later FactForge as endpoint) -> Done
4. Getting the answer and formatting it into a usefull answer -> Work in progress
5. Return it to the user -> Done


## Installation:
It's a package so you can import it (disclaimer: still in development).<br/>
*For development*:`pip install -e ./Veritas` (by pulling it from here) and pull yourself the tntspa repository and initalise the submodules, so you have the version of fairseq we use for development<br/>

All code can be currently found in the `Veritas` folder <br/>
*For using it*: `pip install Veritass` <br/>


## Quickstart:
```from Veritas import modelApi
    m = modelApi.ModelApi()
    ret:list = m.translate(text="What is the biggest Mountin in the US? What is the capital of China?")
    print(ret)
```
## Know Issues:
Often a question won't return an answer or an related answer, we are working on it. (As you can see in the example)

## Extra stuff:
We use the model checkpoint and a code snippet from: https://github.com/xiaoyuin/tntspa and the included fairseq submodule.
