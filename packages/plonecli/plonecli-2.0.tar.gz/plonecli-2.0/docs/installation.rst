Installation
============


Stable Release
==============

To install Plone CLI, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install plonecli --user

to upgrade, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -U plonecli --user

This is the preferred method to install Plone CLI, as it will always install the most recent stable release in the user global site-packages.

If you don't have `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`_ installed, this `Python installation guide <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/>`_
can guide you through the process.
