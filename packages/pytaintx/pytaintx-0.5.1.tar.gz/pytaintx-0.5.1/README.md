**Now Maintained**

# PyTaintX

<img src="readme-assets/icons/name.png" alt="Project Icon" width="750">


Maintained branch of Python Taint for python 3.9

Static analysis of Python web applications based on theoretical
foundations (Control flow graphs, fixed point, dataflow analysis)

## Features

-   Detect command injection, SSRF, SQL injection, XSS, directory
    traveral etc.
-   A lot of customisation possible

For a look at recent changes, please see the
[changelog](https://github.com/python-security/pytaintx/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

Example usage and output:

```
21 vulnerabilities found (plus 3 sanitised):
Vulnerability 1:
File: .\XSS.py
 > User input at line 6, source "request.args.get(":
         ~call_1 = ret_request.args.get('param', 'not set')
Reassigned in:
        File: .\XSS.py
         > Line 6: param = ~call_1
File: .\XSS.py
 > reaches line 9, sink "replace(":
        ~call_5 = ret_html.replace('{{ param }}', param)

[...]
```

## Install With PIP

```python
pip install pytaintx
```

Head to https://pypi.org/project/pytaintx/ for more info


## How it Works

Soon you will find a
[README.rst](https://github.com/python-security/pytaintx/tree/master/pytaintx) in
every directory in the `pytaintx/` folder, [start
here](https://github.com/python-security/pytaintx/tree/master/pytaintx).

## How to Use

1.  Choose a web framework

[The -a option determines which functions will have their arguments
tainted](https://github.com/python-security/pytaintx/tree/master/pytaintx/web_frameworks#web-frameworks),
by default it is Flask.

1.  (optional) Customize source and sink information

Use the `-t` option to specify sources and sinks, by default [this file
is
used](https://github.com/python-security/pytaintx/blob/master/pytaintx/vulnerability_definitions/all_trigger_words.pyt).

1.  (optional) Customize which library functions propagate taint

For functions from builtins or libraries, e.g. `url_for` or
`os.path.join`, use the `-m` option to specify whether or not they
return tainted values given tainted inputs, by [default this file is
used](https://github.com/python-security/pytaintx/blob/master/pytaintx/vulnerability_definitions/blackbox_mapping.json).

Usage
=====

```
usage: python -m pytaintx [-h] [-a ADAPTOR] [-pr PROJECT_ROOT]
                     [-b BASELINE_JSON_FILE] [-j] [-t TRIGGER_WORD_FILE]
                     [-m BLACKBOX_MAPPING_FILE] [-i] [-o OUTPUT_FILE]
                     [--ignore-nosec] [-r] [-x EXCLUDED_PATHS]
                     [--dont-prepend-root] [--no-local-imports]
                     targets [targets ...]

required arguments:
  targets               source file(s) or directory(s) to be scanned

important optional arguments:
  -a ADAPTOR, --adaptor ADAPTOR
                        Choose a web framework adaptor: Flask(Default),
                        Django, Every or Pylons

  -t TRIGGER_WORD_FILE, --trigger-word-file TRIGGER_WORD_FILE
                        Input file with a list of sources and sinks

  -m BLACKBOX_MAPPING_FILE, --blackbox-mapping-file BLACKBOX_MAPPING_FILE
                            Input blackbox mapping file

optional arguments:
  -pr PROJECT_ROOT, --project-root PROJECT_ROOT
                        Add project root, only important when the entry file
                        is not at the root of the project.

  -b BASELINE_JSON_FILE, --baseline BASELINE_JSON_FILE
                        Path of a baseline report to compare against (only
                        JSON-formatted files are accepted)

  -j, --json            Prints JSON instead of report.

  -i, --interactive     Will ask you about each blackbox function call in
                        vulnerability chains.

  -o OUTPUT_FILE, --output OUTPUT_FILE
                        Write report to filename

  --ignore-nosec        Do not skip lines with # nosec comments

  -r, --recursive       Find and process files in subdirectories

  -x EXCLUDED_PATHS, --exclude EXCLUDED_PATHS
                        Separate files with commas

  --dont-prepend-root   In project root e.g. /app, imports are not prepended
                        with app.*

  --no-local-imports    If set, absolute imports must be relative to the
                        project root. If not set, modules in the same
                        directory can be imported just by their names.
```

## Usage from Source

Using it like a user
`python3 -m pytaintx examples/vulnerable_code/XSS_call.py`

Running the tests `python3 -m tests`

Running an individual test file `python3 -m unittest tests.import_test`

Running an individual test
`python3 -m unittest tests.import_test.ImportTest.test_import`



## Virtual env setup guide

Create a directory to hold the virtual env and project

`mkdir ~/a_folder`

`cd ~/a_folder`

Clone the project into the directory

`git clone https://github.com/python-security/pytaintx.git`

Create the virtual environment

`python3 -m venv ~/a_folder/`

Check that you have the right versions

`python3 --version` sample output `Python 3.6.0`

`pip --version` sample output
`pip 9.0.1 from /Users/kevinhock/a_folder/lib/python3.6/site-packages (python 3.6)`

Change to project directory

`cd pytaintx`

In the future, just type `source ~/a_folder/bin/activate` to start
developing.
