        Essential
        =========
        
        This package is a simple gatherer of different news from various APIs.
        
        Currently, it sends all news gathered through e-mails to all the mail addresses from a database.
        
        To send a simple mail to a target without using any database, use the function `prepare_mail` from `mail`.
        
        Currently the gathered news are the following:
        
        - Weather from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org)
        - Top products from [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com)
        - Trending repos from [GitHub](https://github.com)
        - News from [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com) or [Le Figaro](http://www.lefigaro.fr) depending on the language you decide to use (`en` or `fr`)
        
        The package can be installed with:
        
        ```
        pip install smlep-news
        ```
        
        Architecture
        ============
        
        This project is divided in different packages:
        
        - `figaro`: fetches french news from [Le Figaro](http://www.lefigaro.fr).
        - `github`: fetches trending repos from [GitHub](https://github.com).
        - `guardian`: fetches us news from [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com).
        - `mail`: calls gatherer from the other packages, format their content and send mail.
        - `product_hunt`: fetches top products from [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com).
        - `runner`: gathers e-mail addresses from a database and send the gathered news through e-mails. This package configuration is relative to my own setup, if you want to use this program, you should bring changes to this package (or not use it).
        - `weather`: fetches weather from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org). To choose the city you have to provide an ID, a list of city IDs can be downloaded [here](http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/).
        
        Credentials
        ===========
        
        This program uses APIs from different sources, and some of them require authentication.
        You'll have to provide API Keys in environment variables:
        
        - `PH_CLIENT_ID`/`PH_CLIENT_SECRET`: Product Hunt Api Client Id/Client Secret.
        - `WEATHER_KEY`: Open Weather Map Api Key.
        - `GUARDIAN_KEY`: Guardian Api Key.
        
        All these keys can be obtained freely.
        
        To send mails, you need an email account, the default configuration is for `gmail`,
        if you need to use another mail server, you should update the code. If you use
        `gmail`, you only need to provide some environment variables:
        
        - `EMAIL_NAME`
        - `EMAIL_USERNAME`
        - `EMAIL_PASSWORD`
