        ## SQL mapping library for python
        PythonSQLMapper is a database framework for mapping SQL to objects.
        It has a similar design to [iBATIS](http://ibatis.apache.org), but is simpler.
        
        It was originally written in Objective-C for iOS and macOS as [CocoaSQLMapper](https://github.com/marvelph/CocoaSQLMapper).
        PythonSQLMapper is a reimplementation in Python.
        
        This library was written by [Kenji Nishishiro](mailto:marvel@programmershigh.org).
