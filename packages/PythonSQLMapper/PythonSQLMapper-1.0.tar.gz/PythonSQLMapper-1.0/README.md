# PythonSQLMapper
## SQL mapping library for python
PythonSQLMapper is a database framework for mapping SQL to objects.
It has a similar design to [iBATIS](http://ibatis.apache.org), but is simpler.

It was originally written in Objective-C for iOS and macOS as [CocoaSQLMapper](https://github.com/marvelph/CocoaSQLMapper).

This library was written by [Kenji Nishishiro](mailto:marvel@programmershigh.org).
