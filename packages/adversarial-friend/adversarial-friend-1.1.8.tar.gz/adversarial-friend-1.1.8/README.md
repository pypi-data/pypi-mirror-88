## Project Abtract

We will explore parameter interpretation techniques for computer vision tasks, in order to get a deeper understanding of how to deal with real image data. Specifically speaking, the models to be used include generalized linear models like Logistic Regression, as well as more powerful techniques such as convolutional neural networks. What is more, we will document and implement these algorithms to extract the learned concepts that our models detect in input images. Finally, we will use the information, along with automatic input optimization, to programmatically generate adversarial examples using model-agnostic gradient-based methods that trick the learned models into misclassifying input images.
