Description: # Raspberry Pi 
        
        Developed for a Pi Zero W, but should work on the others as well. Just make 
        sure any kind of internet connectivity is available.
        
        ## Install instructions
        
        Used a Raspian image. 
        
        to describe:
        
        * enable SSH
        * enable WiFi
        * ~enable W1~
        * ~(depending on kernel version, use GPIO4 and GPIO17 for W1)~
        
        ### Enable one wire on startup
        
        The script `raspi/scripts/enable_w1.sh` enables W1 on GPIO 4 and 17. Make it executable 
        and start it on each startup, eg. via cronjob:
        
        ```sh
        sudo chmod 755 raspi/scripts/enable_w1.sh
        sudo crontab -e
        ```
        And then in the file add the line:
        ```sh
        @reboot /home/pi/temperature-sensor/raspi/scripts/enable_w1.sh
        ```
        Adjust the path, if you cloned the repo somewhere else.
        
        ## Connect
        
        On the same network, search for the Raspi:
        
        ```bash
        arp -a
        ```
        
        Connect with SSH:
        
        ```bash
        ssh pi@<RASPI IP GOES HERE>
        ```
