        ==================
        
        This is an `OASIS TC Open Repository
        <https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/>`__. See the
        `Governance <#governance>`__ section for more information.
        
        The STIX generator is a tool for generating random STIX content for prototyping
        and testing. It uses a simple, sentence-like syntax for expressing what STIX
        content to generate. This tool is provided in two forms: as a Jupyter notebook
        and as a commandline tool.
        
        For more information, see `the documentation <https://stix2-generator.readthedocs.io/>`__ on ReadTheDocs.
        
        Jupyter Notebook
        ----------------
        
        The `Jupyter notebook <https://jupyter.org/>`__ provides an interactive
        environment to input generator syntax and view the generated content. To use
        the notebook, install the generator's dependencies including the ``jupyter``
        extras, and run Jupyter:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install -e .[jupyter]
            jupyter nbextension install stix2viz --py
            jupyter nbextension enable stix2viz --py
            jupyter notebook
        
        Open ``stix.ipynb`` in Jupyter to use the tool. Look at ``examples.ipynb`` for
        documentation and examples of the syntax.
        
        Commandline Tool
        ----------------
        
        The commandline version of the tool reads prototyping language from a file, and
        prints the generated objects to stdout.  If a bundle is selected, the bundle is
        printed instead.
        
        .. code-block::
        
            usage: build_stix.py [-h] [-b] [-e ENCODING] [-v] [--stix-version {2.0,2.1}]
                                 [--extra-specs EXTRA_SPECS] [-m]
                                 language-file
        
            Create STIX content from the STIX prototyping language
        
            positional arguments:
              language-file         The file containing STIX prototyping language
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -b, --bundle          Create a bundle
              -e ENCODING, --encoding ENCODING
                                    Encoding to use when reading text files, e.g. STIX
                                    prototyping language, custom generator specifications,
                                    etc. Default=utf-8
              -v, --verbose         Enable verbose diagnostic output. Repeat for increased
                                    verbosity.
              --stix-version {2.0,2.1}
                                    STIX version to use. Default=2.1
              --extra-specs EXTRA_SPECS
                                    A JSON file with extra object generator
                                    specifications. These will be merged with the built-in
                                    specifications, and made available for use in
                                    prototyping language content.
              -m, --minimize-refs   Minimize reference properties in generated objects
                                    (*_ref and *_refs).
        
        Caveats
        -------
        
        The tool generates random data for all properties, so it may be nonsensical but
        will have the correct datatype or structure according to the STIX
        specification.
        
        The object generator currently only generates STIX 2.1 objects. The commandline
        tool and some APIs will error out if any STIX version other than "2.1" is used.
