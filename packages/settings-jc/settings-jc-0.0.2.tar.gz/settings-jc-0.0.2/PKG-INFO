        ## Features
        ## Documentation
        
        The default default settings are in the form:<br>
        setting_name=value<br>
        
        For example, if you wish to save the default value for X then your default settings file would contain
        the following:<br>
        X=123
        
        Comments are lines starting with #, so an example file may be:<br>
        <pre>
        # 
        # settings.txt
        #
        # default settings for my application
        #
        X=123
        </pre>
        
        The actual settings are stored in the following folder depending on OS.  The settings are stored in:<br>  
        Windows: %appdata%\appname\settings<br>
        Unix/Linux: $HOME/appname/settings<br>
        
        The settings file is encrypted with a key derived from the computer's system id.  
        This system id should be specific to the execution system.  Please note, it is 
        very unlikely you could copy the settings file from one system and use 
        on another system.  Since the system id is unique to the system, the encryption key
        will be different for each system.
