AMMOS Instrument Toolkit (AIT) Deep Space Network (DSN) Interface
=================================================================

AIT DSN provides APIS for connecting to spacecraft communication facilities via Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) Space Link Extension (SLE) interfaces. AIT DSN supports the following interfaces:

- Return All Frames (RAF) interface (v4 and v5)
- Return Channel Frames (RCF) interface (v4 and v5)
- Forward Communications Link Transmission Unit (CLTU) interface (v4 and v5)
- CCSDS File Delivery Protocol Class 1 interface

Interface specifications are available in the `CCSDS Blue Books <https://public.ccsds.org/publications/BlueBooks.aspx>`__
