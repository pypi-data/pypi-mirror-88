Description: # pnguin
        A simple, lightweight DataFrame library with dual-axis (either row or column mode) support, and remote DB DataFrames.
        
        ## Usage
        This library is currently in development
        
        ## Why pnguin?
        Well, Penguins are cute. Pandas are cute. This is a Pandas alternative, and the name `penguin` was taken. So I just got rid of the `e`. 
        On a fun side note though, this let's us now use this as: `import pnguin as pn` -- close enough to `import pandas as pd`, don't you think?
