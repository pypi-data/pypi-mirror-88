Description: Lightweight library for JSON graph 
        ==================================
        
        Library, similar to:
        
        https://github.com/jsongraph/jsongraph.py
        
        **NB: `json-graph-lite` library uses list for nodes, not object, so it's not compatible with JSON Graph Format.**
        
        JSON Graph Format compatible classes (Graph, Graphs) can be found from `json_graph_lite.jgf`.
        
        Incompatible change: list is used for nodes, not object, because JSON object can't represent integer keys.
        
        The intention of json-graph-lite is to provide lightweight graph library, which serializes
        and deserializes graphs a la JSON graph format.
        
        Take a look at [tests/test_graphs.py](tests/test_graphs.py) for usage examples.
