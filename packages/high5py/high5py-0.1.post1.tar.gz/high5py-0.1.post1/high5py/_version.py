"""
Module where the version is written.

'a' or 'alpha' means alpha version (internal testing)

'b' or 'beta' means beta version (external testing)

Append with .postN for post-release updates.  This may be necessary for changes
in packaging or documentation, as PyPI does not allow uploads of files with the
same filename (which corresponds to the version number).
