Features
--------

ssf (Spreadsheet Format) is a pure python library to format data using ECMA-376
spreadsheet format codes (used in popular spreadsheet software packages).  It is
derived from the JavaScript version available at https://github.com/SheetJS/ssf.
All listed issues in that package, up to #80, have been fixed in this version
and support for colors, widths, and localization including alternative
calendars have also been implemented.
