Usage
-----

To use these, you can import them and use them
with matplotlib as you would with any other color map.

```python
from swiftascmaps import red
from matplotlib.pyplot import imshow
from numpy import random

imshow(random.rand(128, 128), cmap=red)
```

Note
----

Of course, these aren't necessarily designed to be colorblind
friendly, or perceptually uniform, so use them with caution.
They are quite pretty though.
