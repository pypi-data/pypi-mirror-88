This is an optional package for SageMath containing code I wrote for research.
It contains modules on the following topics.

**Discrete dynamical systems**
  diophantine approximation, Markov transformations, Wang tilings, Lyapunov
  exponents, matrix cocycles, multidimensional continued fraction algorithms,
  polyhedron exchange transformations, GIFS.

**Combinatorics**
  2d substitutions, bispecial factors, bond percolation, Dyck word in 3D,
  words, Joyal bijection, languages, Oldenburger sequence, ostrowski
  numeration, partial injections,

**Digital geometry**
  Christoffel graph, discrete subset, discrete plane, double square tiles,
  polyhedron partitions,

**Vizualization**

Prerequisites - System packages (easy to install)
-------------------------------------------------

Some functionalities of ``slabbe`` package depend on the installation of
packages on the system such as pdflatex, lualatex (lualatex compiles large
tikzpicture exceeding the memory limits of pdflatex), pdf2svg as well as
softwares including ImageMagick__ (to convert pdf to png so that tikzpicture
appear directly in the Jupyter notebook), Graphviz__ (to draw graphs). 

__ https://imagemagick.org/
__ https://graphviz.org/

On Debian or Ubuntu, one may do::

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install texlive texlive-latex-extra texlive-luatex -qy
    sudo apt install graphviz imagemagick pdf2svg -y

The installation of imagemagick done above provides the command ``convert`` but
it does not *allow* to convert pdf to png unless you edit the Imagemagick's
``policy.xml`` file which can be done as follows (thanks to `Naveed's comment
on stackoverflow`__)::

    sudo sed -i '/PDF/s/none/read|write/' /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml

__ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42928765/

On **OSX**, one should first `install Homebrew`__. Then one can install the
above packages similarly as above using ``brew`` instead of ``apt``::

    sudo brew install graphviz imagemagick pdf2svg

__ https://brew.sh/

Prerequisites - SageMath optional packages
------------------------------------------

Installing slabbe requires a working SageMath installation (with Cython and
gcc). Depending on the usage, it might be necessary to install the optional
sagemath packages dot2tex__ (translate dot file to tikz to draw nice graphs),
glucose__ (SAT solver) and latte_int__::

    sage -i dot2tex glucose latte_int

Note that graphviz must be installed *before* dot2tex.

Installation
------------

The module is distributed on PyPI and is easily installed through the Python
package manager pip::

    sage -pip install slabbe

To install the module in your user space (which does not require administrator
rights)::

    sage -pip install slabbe --user

To install the most recent development version::

    sage -pip install --upgrade git+https://gitlab.com/seblabbe/slabbe

Usage::

    sage: from slabbe import *

Other System packages you may want to install
---------------------------------------------

Some functionalities of ``slabbe`` package depend on the installation of a
linear program solver such as Gurobi__. See the thematic tutorial to setup the
`installation of Gurobi in SageMath``__.

__ http://www.gurobi.com/
__ http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/linear_programming.html#using-cplex-or-gurobi-through-sage

It builds on SageMath
---------------------

It depends heavily on the SageMath library as it uses the following modules:
combinat, functions, geometry, graphs, matrix, misc, modules, numerical,
parallel, plot, probability, rings, sat, sets, structure, symbolic.

SageMath__ is free open source math software that supports research and
teaching in algebra, geometry, number theory, cryptography, and related areas.  

__ http://www.sagemath.org/

Follows the Best practices for scientific computing
---------------------------------------------------

It follows as much as possible the `SageMath general conventions`__ and the
`Best Practices for Scientific Computing`__. Each module is fully documented
and doctested. Before each new release, we make sure that all examples are
working. As the `ReScience Journal`__ says: "*Reproducible science is good.
Replicated Science is better*".

Future inclusion into Sage
--------------------------

Some modules may have a wider interest to the SageMath community
(``tikz_picture.py`` for example) and could be included in SageMath at some
point. Please contact the author if you want to act as a reviewer for some
module(s) and I will create a ticket on trac__ for its inclusion into SageMath.
