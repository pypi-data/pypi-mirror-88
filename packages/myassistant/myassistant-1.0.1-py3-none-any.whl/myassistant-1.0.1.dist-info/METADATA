## Errors

there are some chances to get some errors for example 
you can get a error while installing the this module like ```pyaudio``` wheel file is not installing as same in ```psutils``` because many of users face these type of errors so you can separately download wheel files form ```https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/``` and then install them. this method can pull you out from this problem. if you face any other type of problem contect me by mail i will try to solve your problem ,Thanks for using this module :)
