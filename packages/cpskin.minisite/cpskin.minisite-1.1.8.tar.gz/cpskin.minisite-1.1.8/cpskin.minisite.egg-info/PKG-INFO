        UI for sections of site configured with their own domain.
        
        Overview
        ========
        Those sections are named mini sites.
        
        When a mini site is traversed, the request is marked with
        
        ``IInMinisite`` if the domain used is the mini site domain,
        
        or
        
        ``IInPortal`` if the domain used is the portal domain.
        
        The request is also decorated with a ``cpskin_minisite`` attribute
        which holds an instance of ``cpskin.minisite.minisite.Minisite`` class.
        
        The instance has the following attributes :
        
        ``main_portal_url``
          The url under which the portal is served.
        
        ``minisite_url``
          The url under which the section is served as a minisite.
        
        ``minisite_urls``
          The urls under which the section is served as a minisite. Use minisite_url OR minisite_urls (urls are separeted with coma)
        
        ``search_path``
          The location of the section, expressed as a path from the Zope root.
        
        ``is_in_minisite_mode``
          Is the current request served as minisite ?
        
        ``is_in_portal_mode``
          Is the current request served as portal ?
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        The mini sites are configured by placing files in directory named ``minisites`` inside the ``CLIENT_HOME`` directory.
        
        The ``CLIENT_HOME`` directory is found inside the ``var`` directory in a
        standard instance built with buildout recipe ``plone.recipe.zope2instance``.
        
        Typically, the files must be saved in ``buildout_dir/var/instance/minisites``.
        
        The configuration file is a INI-file format file. Each section is configured as
        below::
        
            [/plone/folder/minisite]
            minisite_url = http://minisite/url
            portal_url = http://localhost
        
        
        Where the section name is the minisite path from the Zope root.
        The ``minisite_url`` holds the url with the specific domain under which the minisite
        must be served.
        The ``portal_url`` holds the url with the specific domain under which the
        portal is served.
