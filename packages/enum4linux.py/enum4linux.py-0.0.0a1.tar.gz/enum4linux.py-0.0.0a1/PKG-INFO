        =============
        
        ## Intro
        This repository tries to port the `enum4linux` utility from it's native perl version to python.
        
        Perl repo https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/enum4linux.
        
        This is supposed to be a python module that you can install via `pip` and then later use as a CLI utility, just as how we use gunicorn, black etc.
        
        ## Usage
        ```
        $ enum4linux --help
        ```
        ## Development
        TBD
