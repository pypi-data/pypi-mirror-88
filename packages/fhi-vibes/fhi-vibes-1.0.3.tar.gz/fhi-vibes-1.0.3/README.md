FHI-vibes
===

Welcome to `FHI-vibes`, a `python` package for calculating, analyzing, and understanding the vibrational properties of solids from first principles. `FHI-vibes` is intended to seamlessly bridge between the harmonic approximation and fully anharmonic molecular dynamics simulations. To this end, `FHI-vibes` builds on several [existing packages](https://vibes-developers.gitlab.io/vibes/Credits/) and interfaces them in a consistent and user-friendly fashion. 

In the documentation and tutorials, knowledge of first-principles electronic-structure theory as well as proficiency with _ab initio_ codes such as [FHI-aims](https://aimsclub.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/) and high-performance computing are assumed. Additional experience with Python, the [Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/), or [Phonopy](https://atztogo.github.io/phonopy/) is helpful, but not needed.

`FHI-vibes` provides the following features:

- Geometry optimization via [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/optimize.html#module-ase.optimize),
- harmonic phonon calculations via [Phonopy](https://atztogo.github.io/phonopy/),
- molecular dynamics simulations in [NVE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/md.html#constant-nve-simulations-the-microcanonical-ensemble), [NVT](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/md.html#module-ase.md.langevin), and [NPT](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/md.html#module-ase.md.nptberendsen) ensembles,
- [harmonic sampling](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.115504), and
- [anharmonicity quantification](https://journals.aps.org/prmaterials/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.4.083809).

Most of the functionality is high-throughput ready via [fireworks](https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/#).
