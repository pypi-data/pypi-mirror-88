# Binaries extraction
This package contains the tools to easily extract binary data from PX3:
*Heat Log
*2 Second Log
*Wave Log
Into a pandas dataframe for further processing  

#### Usage
Importing a function is done the same way as any python package:

```
from AmiAutomation import PX3_Bin
```

From there you can call a method with the module prefix:

```
dataFrame = PX3_Bin.file_to_df(path = "C:\\Binaries")
```

#### Methods
This method returns a single pandas dataframe containing extracted data from the provided
    file, path or path with constrained dates 

* **file_to_df ( path, file, start_time, end_time, verbose = False )**

 *  To process a single file you need to provide the absolute path in the file argument

```
dataFrame = PX3_Bin.file_to_df(file = "C:\\Binaries\\20240403T002821Z$-4038953271967.bin")
```

 * To process several files just provide the directory path where the binaries are (binaries inside sub-directories are also included) 

```
dataFrame = PX3_Bin.file_to_df(path = "C:\\Binaries\\")
```

* You can constrain the binaries inside a directory (and sub-directories) by also providing a start-date or both a start date and end date as a python datetime.datetime object

```
import datetime

time = datetime.datetime(2020,2,15,13,30) # February 15th 2020, 1:30 PM

### This returns ALL the data available in the path from the given date to the actual time
dataFrame = PX3_Bin.file_to_df(path = "C:\\Binaries\\", start_time=time)
```

```
import datetime

time_start = datetime.datetime(2020,2,15,13,30) # February 15th 2020, 1:30 PM
time_end = datetime.datetime(2020,2,15,13,45) # February 15th 2020, 1:45 PM

### This returns all the data available in the path from the given 15 minutes
dataFrame = PX3_Bin.file_to_df(path = "C:\\Binaries\\", start_time=time_start, end_time=time_end )
```
