In mathematics and computer fields, a large number of numerical methods require derivatives to be calculated(Margossian, 2019). For example, in machine learning, gradient plays an essential role. Neural networks are able to gradually increase accuracy with every training session through the process of gradient descent(Wang, 2019).  In physics, differentiation is needed to quantify the rate of change in the equations of motion. However, for many problems, calculating derivatives analytically is both time consuming and computationally impractical. Automatic differentiation can gives exact answers in constant time(Saroufim, 2019), which is a powerful tool to automate the calculation of derivatives, especially when differentiating complex algorithms and mathematical functions(Margossian, 2019).  \n\nThere are three main methods of calculating derivatives: numerical differentiation, symbolic differentiation, and automatic differentiation. Specifically, symbolic differentiation involves computing exact expressions for the derivatives in terms of the function variables by representing the expression as a tree and manipulating it using the rules of differentiation. The derivatives can quickly become very complicated for complex functions and higher-order derivatives. Thus, for complicated functions, symbolic differentiation is not easily generalizable and becomes computationally inefficient due to redundant evaluations of different components of the function . Numerical differentiation aims to approximate derivatives through finite differentiating, but the solution accuracy is greatly affected by the truncation and round-off errors associated with finite difference formulas. Automatic differentiation is more computationally efficient and generalizable than symbolic differentiation and can find exact derivatives as opposed to numerical differentiation.\n\nIn this library, we will describe the mathematical background and concepts in the Background section, explain the software organization, and discuss the implementation of the forward mode of automatic differentiation.\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00002-beeaf662-2ede-4583-a414-f25e148ac07d","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Background\n\nAutomatic differentiation assumes that we are working with a differentiable function composed of a finite number of elementary functions and operations with known symbolic derivatives.

For instance x`**`3 returns 2`*`x`*`2      |\n| `sqrt`                  | Square root is a special case of pow and therefore can be implemented by calling __pow__ with exponent `1\\2`    |\n| `sin`                   | evaluates `sin` and `cos` (the derivative of sine function)    |\n| `cos`                   | evaluates `cos` and its derivative -`sin`    |\n| `exp`                   | evaluates `exp` and its derivative `exp`  |\n| `log`                   | evaluates `log` and its derivative `1/arg`     |\n| `jacobian_matrix`       | Returns the computed jacobian matrix             |\n| `differentiate`         | Specify the mode (defaulting to forward mode ) and returns the derivative vector/scalar            |\n\n\nNote: other mathematical operations (e.g. summation, division, etc) will have corresponding function definitions as well\n\n#### External Dependencies\nIn addition to the built-in libraries, we will use `numpy` package for implementation.\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00006-b22de42d-90cc-452a-b4a5-9be698938663","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Feedback\n\n## Milestone 1\n\nIntroduction\n- How does AD compare and improve from other similar methods?\n    - Added comparison with numerical method and symbolic method.\n\nBackground\n- The flow could be enhanced by presenting an evaluation trace along with the computational graph.\n    - Added an evaluation trace for the provided example\n\nHow to use\n- How do you install the package?
