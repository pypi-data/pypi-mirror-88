Description: best-effort representations using smaller coded character sets (ASCII,
        ISO 8859, etc.).  The translation tables used by the codecs are from
        the ``transtab`` collection by Markus Kuhn.
        
        Three types of transliterating codecs are provided:
        
          "long", using as many characters as needed to make a natural
           replacement.  For example, \u00e4 LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH
           DIAERESIS ``ä`` will be replaced with ``ae``.
        
          "short", using the minimum number of characters to make a
          replacement.  For example, \u00e4 LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH
          DIAERESIS ``ä`` will be replaced with ``a``.
        
          "one", only performing single character replacements.  Characters
          that can not be transliterated with a single character are passed
          through unchanged. For example, \u2639 WHITE FROWNING FACE ``☹``
          will be passed through unchanged.
        
        Using the codecs is simple::
        
          >>> import translitcodec
          >>> import codecs
          >>> codecs.encode('fácil € ☺', 'translit/long')
          'facil EUR :-)'
          >>> codecs.encode('fácil € ☺', 'translit/short')
          'facil E :-)'
        
        The codecs return Unicode by default.  To receive a bytestring back,
        either chain the output of encode() to another codec, or append the
        name of the desired byte encoding to the codec name::
        
          >>> codecs.encode('fácil € ☺', 'translit/one').encode('ascii', 'replace')
          'facil E ?'
          >>> 'fácil € ☺'.encode('translit/one/ascii', 'replace')
          'facil E ?'
        
        The package also supplies a 'transliterate' codec, an alias for
        'translit/long'.
