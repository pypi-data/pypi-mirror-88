## Basic Usage

`demoji` requires an initial data download from the Unicode Consortium's [emoji code repository](http://unicode.org/Public/emoji/12.0/emoji-test.txt).

On first use of the package, call `download_codes()`:

```python
>>> import demoji
>>> demoji.download_codes()
Downloading emoji data ...
... OK (Got response in 0.14 seconds)
Writing emoji data to /Users/brad/.demoji/codes.json ...
... OK
```

This will store the Unicode hex-notated symbols at `~/.demoji/codes.json` for future use.

`demoji` exports several text-related functions for find-and-replace functionality with emojis:

```python
>>> tweet = """\
... #startspreadingthenews yankees win great start by üéÖüèæ going 5strong innings with 5k‚Äôsüî• üêÇ
... solo homerun üåãüåã with 2 solo homeruns andüëπ 3run homerun‚Ä¶ ü§° üö£üèº üë®üèΩ‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è with rbi‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ üî•üî•
... üá≤üáΩ and üá≥üáÆ to close the gameüî•üî•!!!‚Ä¶.
... WHAT A GAME!!..
... """
>>> demoji.findall(tweet)
{
    "üî•": "fire",
    "üåã": "volcano",
    "üë®üèΩ\u200d‚öñÔ∏è": "man judge: medium skin tone",
    "üéÖüèæ": "Santa Claus: medium-dark skin tone",
    "üá≤üáΩ": "flag: Mexico",
    "üëπ": "ogre",
    "ü§°": "clown face",
    "üá≥üáÆ": "flag: Nicaragua",
    "üö£üèº": "person rowing boat: medium-light skin tone",
    "üêÇ": "ox",
}
```

See [below](#reference) for function API.

The reason that `demoji` requires a download rather than coming pre-packaged with Unicode emoji data is that the emoji list itself is frequently updated and changed.  You are free to periodically update the local cache by calling `demoji.download_codes()` every so often.

To pull your last-downloaded date, you can use the `last_downloaded_timestamp()` helper:

```python
>>> demoji.last_downloaded_timestamp()
datetime.datetime(2019, 2, 9, 7, 42, 24, 433776, tzinfo=<demoji.UTC object at 0x101b9ecf8>)
```

The result will be `None` if codes have not previously been downloaded.

## Reference

Note: `Text` refers to [`typing.Text`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Text), an alias for `str` in Python 3 or `unicode` in Python 2.

```python
download_codes() -> None
```

Download emoji data to \~/.demoji/codes.json.  Required at first module usage, and can be used to periodically update data.

```python
findall(string: Text) -> Dict[Text, Text]
```

Find emojis within `string`.  Return a mapping of `{emoji: description}`.

```python
findall_list(string: Text, desc: bool = True) -> List[Text]
```

Find emojis within `string`.  Return a list (with possible duplicates).

If `desc` is True, the list contains description codes.  If `desc` is False, the list contains emojis.

```python
replace(string: Text, repl: Text = "") -> Text
```

Replace emojis in `string` with `repl`.

```python
replace_with_desc(string: Text, sep: Text = ":") -> Text
```

Replace emojis in `string` with their description codes.  The codes are surrounded by `sep`.

```python
last_downloaded_timestamp() -> Optional[datetime.datetime]
```

Show the timestamp of last download from `download_codes()`.

## Footnote: Emoji Sequences

Numerous emojis that look like single Unicode characters are actually multi-character sequences.  Examples:

- The keycap 2Ô∏è‚É£ is actually 3 characters, U+0032 (the ASCII digit 2), U+FE0F (variation selector), and U+20E3 (combining enclosing keycap).
- The flag of Scotland 7 component characters, `b'\\U0001f3f4\\U000e0067\\U000e0062\\U000e0073\\U000e0063\\U000e0074\\U000e007f'` in full esaped notation.

(You can see any of these through `s.encode("unicode-escape")`.)

`demoji` is careful to handle this and should find the full sequences rather than their incomplete subcomponents.

The way it does this it to sort emoji codes by their length, and then compile a concatenated regular expression that will greedily search for longer emojis first, falling back to shorter ones if not found.  This is not by any means a super-optimized way of searching as it has O(N<sup>2</sup>) properties, but the focus is on accuracy and completeness.

```python
>>> from pprint import pprint
>>> seq = """\
... I bet you didn't know that üôã, üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, and üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è are three different emojis.
... """
>>> pprint(seq.encode('unicode-escape'))  # Python 3
(b"I bet you didn't know that \\U0001f64b, \\U0001f64b\\u200d\\u2642\\ufe0f,"
 b' and \\U0001f64b\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0f are three different emojis.\\n')
```
