        =======================
        visaplan.plone.adapters
        =======================
        
        Provides a brown bag of adapters for Plone sites
        
        The purpose of this package is *not* to provide new functionality
        but to factor out existing functionality from an existing monolitic Zope product.
        Thus, it is more likely to lose functionality during further development
        (as parts of it will be forked out into their own packages,
        or some functionality may even become obsolete because there are better
        alternatives in standard Plone components).
        
        
        Features

        - ``pc2`` adapter:
        
          The ``portal_catalog`` as a ``decorated_tool``
          (which logs its calls; for development)
        
        - ``pformat`` adapter:
        
          Makes the ``pprint.pformat`` function available for page template code
          (for development)
        
        - ``puc`` adapter:
        
          The ``portal_user_catalog`` (if you have one)
        
        - ``rawbyname`` adapter:

        - ``uidorint`` adapter:

          file and write it to a ``CSV`` file.
