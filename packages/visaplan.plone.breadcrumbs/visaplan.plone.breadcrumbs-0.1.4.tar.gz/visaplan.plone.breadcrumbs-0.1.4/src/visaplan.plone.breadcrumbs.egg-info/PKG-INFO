        ==========================
        visaplan.plone.breadcrumbs
        ==========================
        
        This package provides breadcrumbs classes for object trees in Zope/Plone
        instances; e.g., it is possible to have the ``uid`` request variable used for
        the breadcrumb if a certain template is used.
        
        For each view template name, it allows the registration of an executable
        breadcrumbs instance, which may create zero or more breadcrumbs and then give
        over processing to a parent breadcrumb. Such breadcrumbs instances usually use
        the current value of a certain request variable, or they may suppress the
        creation of any breadcrumbs at all.
        
        **NOTE:**
        
        The purpose of this package is *not* to provide new functionality
        but to factor out existing functionality from an existing monolitic Zope product.
        Thus, it is more likely to lose functionality during further development
        (as parts of it will be forked out into their own packages,
        or some functionality may even become obsolete because there are better
        alternatives in standard Plone components).
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Breadcrumbs classes for several use cases
        - A simple registry for breadcrumbs and the templates they are triggered by
        
        Due to it's history, this package still has a few dependencies which are not
        really important for the core functionality but rather are related to
        particular breadcrumbs classes of our old monolithic product and it's eggified
        successors. For this reason, and because of some weaknesses of the current
        breadcrumbs registry, the current versions are called *0.x*.
        
        Before you fork you own mycompany.plone.breadcrumbs package, here is what we
        plan for the 1.x versions:
        
        - The ``register`` function will take ...
        
          - the *name* of a breadcrumbs class,
          - the (single) parent (or ``None``, for the standard breadcrumbs from the
            objects tree), and
          - optional keyword arguments.
        
          Currently, it takes an instance of a breadcrumbs class, and the further
          information thrown at the breadcrumbs class when constructing the instance.
          The main drawback is that the parent breadcrumb needs to already exist when a
          new breadcrumb is to be registered, which leads to very annoying module
          dependenies.
        
          Thus, versions 1.x will take all the necessary information during
          registration, and will create a breadcrumb instance when it is first used,
          including the ``parent`` (and "grandparents", if any).
        
        - The ``parents`` list will be replaced by a single ``parent``;
          each breadcrumb has exactly one parent to which it hands over it's results
          after processing (or ``None``, which will cause the usual standard
          breadcrumbs to be created from the objects tree).
        
        - The ``tweak`` method will likely be renamed to something more reasonable;
          unless someone comes up with something better, this will be ``process``.
          It's signature might change, too.
