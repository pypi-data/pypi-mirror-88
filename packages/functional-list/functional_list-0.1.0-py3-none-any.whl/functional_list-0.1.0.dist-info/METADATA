# Description
This litle package is create to allow use to use functional style in a list object.
It is more easier to use when we have for example to deal with a several transforrmation
in our data. 

In this little package, we can find most of function used in a list object but with map
or reduce or flatten,... method. If you are familiar with spark rdd,
the behavior of all of the method in this object that il create 
with the ListMapper object is mostly the same as the method in rdd
spark. The difference is that it includes some properties of a python list.

## News
Now a doc-string is add to this package, so you can use it 
and have some example of how to use a method in the object
created with ListMapper

## Issues:
you can use this package only work with __python version >=3.6__
If you attempt to use it with anterior version, there will be
an error.
