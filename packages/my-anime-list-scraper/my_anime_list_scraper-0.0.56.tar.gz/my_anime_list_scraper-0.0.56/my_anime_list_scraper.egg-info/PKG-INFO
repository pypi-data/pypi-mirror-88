Description: # my_anime_list_scraper
        A package to easily scrape www.myanimelist.com. The purpose of this package is to scrape large amounts of data from MyAnimeList, not to request individual information about a specific item within MyAnimeList. This package can be used to request individual information, but would recommend you to look towards another tool for that as this was not created with that in mind. 
        
        *my_anime_list_scraper* is being developed mainly for [anibrain.ai](https://anibrain.ai). This package will be updated as needed for the site mentioned above. If you require additional information currently not available through this package, please reach out or feel free to contribute.

           "Synopsis":"In the year 2071, humanity has colonized several of the planets and moons of the solar system leaving the now uninhabitable surface of planet Earth behind. The Inter Solar System Police attempts to keep peace in the galaxy, aided in part by outlaw bounty hunters, referred to as \"Cowboys.\" The ragtag team aboard the spaceship Bebop are two such individuals. Mellow and carefree Spike Spiegel is balanced by his boisterous, pragmatic partner Jet Black as the pair makes a living chasing bounties and collecting rewards. Thrown off course by the addition of new members that they meet in their travels—Ein, a genetically engineered, highly intelligent Welsh Corgi; femme fatale Faye Valentine, an enigmatic trickster with memory loss; and the strange computer whiz kid Edward Wong—the crew embarks on thrilling adventures that unravel each member\\'s dark and mysterious past little by little. Well-balanced with high density action and light-hearted comedy, Cowboy Bebop is a space Western classic and an homage to the smooth and improvised music it is named after. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
