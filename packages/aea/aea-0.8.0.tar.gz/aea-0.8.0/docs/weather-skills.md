The AEA weather skills demonstrate an interaction between two AEAs.

* The provider of weather data (the `weather_station`).
* The buyer of weather data (the `weather_client`).

## Discussion

The scope of the specific demo is to demonstrate how to create a simple AEA with the usage of the AEA framework and a database. The weather_station AEA
will read data from the database, that is populated with readings from a weather station, based on the requested dates and will deliver the data to the client upon payment.
This demo does not utilize a smart contract. As a result, we interact with a ledger only to complete a transaction.

You can use this AEA as an example of how to read data from a database and advertise these to possible clients.  

## Communication

This diagram shows the communication between the various entities as data is successfully sold by the weather station AEA to the client.

## Preparation instructions

### Dependencies

Follow the <a href="../quickstart/#preliminaries">Preliminaries</a> and <a href="../quickstart/#installation">Installation</a> sections from the AEA quick start.

## Demo instructions:

A demo to run the same scenario but with a true ledger transaction on Fetch.ai `testnet` or Ethereum `ropsten` network. This demo assumes the buyer
trusts the seller AEA to send the data upon successful payment.

### Create the weather station

First, fetch the AEA that will provide weather measurements:
``` bash
aea fetch fetchai/weather_station:0.19.0 --alias my_weather_station
cd my_weather_station
aea install
```

<details><summary>Alternatively, create from scratch.</summary>
<p>

The following steps create the weather station from scratch:
``` bash
aea create my_weather_station
cd my_weather_station
aea add connection fetchai/p2p_libp2p:0.13.0
aea add connection fetchai/soef:0.14.0
aea add connection fetchai/ledger:0.11.0
aea add skill fetchai/weather_station:0.17.0
aea install
aea config set agent.default_connection fetchai/p2p_libp2p:0.13.0
```

In `weather_station/aea-config.yaml` add 
``` yaml
default_routing:
  fetchai/ledger_api:0.8.0: fetchai/ledger:0.11.0
  fetchai/oef_search:0.11.0: fetchai/soef:0.14.0
```

</p>
</details>


### Create the weather client

In another terminal, fetch the AEA that will query the weather station:
``` bash
aea fetch fetchai/weather_client:0.20.0 --alias my_weather_client
cd my_weather_client
aea install
```

<details><summary>Alternatively, create from scratch.</summary>
<p>

The following steps create the weather client from scratch:
``` bash
aea create my_weather_client
cd my_weather_client
aea add connection fetchai/p2p_libp2p:0.13.0
aea add connection fetchai/soef:0.14.0
aea add connection fetchai/ledger:0.11.0
aea add skill fetchai/weather_client:0.17.0
aea install
aea config set agent.default_connection fetchai/p2p_libp2p:0.13.0
```

In `my_weather_client/aea-config.yaml` add 
``` yaml
default_routing:
  fetchai/ledger_api:0.8.0: fetchai/ledger:0.11.0
  fetchai/oef_search:0.11.0: fetchai/soef:0.14.0
```

</p>
</details>


### Add keys for the weather station AEA

First, create the private key for the weather station AEA based on the network you want to transact. To generate and add a private-public key pair for Fetch.ai `AgentLand` use:
``` bash
aea generate-key fetchai
aea add-key fetchai fetchai_private_key.txt
aea add-key fetchai fetchai_private_key.txt --connection
```

### Add keys and generate wealth for the weather client AEA

The weather client needs to have some wealth to purchase the service from the weather station.

First, create the private key for the weather client AEA based on the network you want to transact. To generate and add a private-public key pair for Fetch.ai `AgentLand` use:
``` bash
aea generate-key fetchai
aea add-key fetchai fetchai_private_key.txt
aea add-key fetchai fetchai_private_key.txt --connection
```

Then, create some wealth for your weather client based on the network you want to transact with. On the Fetch.ai `AgentLand` network:
``` bash
aea generate-wealth fetchai
```

### Run the AEAs

Run both AEAs from their respective terminals.

First, run the weather station AEA:

``` bash
aea run
```

Once you see a message of the form `To join its network use multiaddr: ['SOME_ADDRESS']` take note of the address.

Then, update the configuration of the weather client AEA's p2p connection (in `vendor/fetchai/connections/p2p_libp2p/connection.yaml`) replace the following:

``` yaml
config:
  delegate_uri: 127.0.0.1:11001
  entry_peers: ['SOME_ADDRESS']
  local_uri: 127.0.0.1:9001
  log_file: libp2p_node.log
  public_uri: 127.0.0.1:9001
```

where `SOME_ADDRESS` is replaced accordingly.

Then run the weather client AEA:
``` bash
aea run
```

You will see that the AEAs negotiate and then transact using the selected ledger.

### Delete the AEAs

When you're done, go up a level and delete the AEAs.

``` bash
cd ..
aea delete my_weather_station
aea delete my_weather_client
```
