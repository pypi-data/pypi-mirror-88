Description: # cpotp
        [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/cpotp.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cpotp)
        
        Command line tool to copy the latest OTP received in the connected Android device to the clipboard.
        
        ## Why?
        Simply because I don't want to pickup my phone, open the SMS app, remember the OTP, then enter it.
        Now you might say, haven't you heard about https://messages.google.com/web ?
        Well 
        
        ## How?
        
        ## Prerequisite
        - Python >=3.6
        - [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/chrome/) / [Chromium](https://download-chromium.appspot.com/) / [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) / [Microsoft Edge Dev for Linux] (https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/)
        - [xclip](https://github.com/astrand/xclip) (if you're on Linux)
        
        ## Installation
        
        cpotp can be installed using pip
        
        ```
        pip install cpotp
        ```
        
        or install it from the source
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/riteshpanjwani/cpotp.git
        cd cpotp
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        If you are using any fairly recent Debian Linux-based OS, install xclip
        
        ```
        sudo apt install xclip
        ```
        
        else, you can install it directly from the source
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/astrand/xclip.git
        ./bootstrap
        ./configure
        make
        make install
        ```
        Verify that it installed
        
        ```
        man xclip
        ```
        
        Next, you need to set an environment variable called CHROME_USER_DATA_DIR,
        Run chrome://version in Chrome/Edge/Chromium browser new tab
        and set this environment variable to path given in "Profile Path"
        except the "/Default" part.
        Example: export CHROME_USER_DATA_DIR=/home/riteshp/.config/google-chrome
        
        ## Usage
        Fire up a terminal / command prompt and run:
        
        ```
        cpotp
        ```
