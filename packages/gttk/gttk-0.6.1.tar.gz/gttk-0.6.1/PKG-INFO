Description: # GTK Theme for Python's tkinter/ttk
        ![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/TkinterEP/python-gttk.svg?branch=master)
        [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/80y25364onq2anmw/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/RedFantom/python-gttk/branch/master)
        
        Would you like to have a more native look for your Tkinter application?
        Are the themes provided in [ttkthemes](https://github.com/TkinterEP/ttkthemes)
        not to your liking?
        
        This package provides a version of [`gtkTtk`](https://github.com/Geballin/gtkTtk),
        formerly [`tilegtk`](https://github.com/xiaq/tile-gtk) packaged for
        usage with Python. Simply follow the installation instructions and all
        required files are installed to the site package directory.
        
        ## Installation
        Currently, a build process for Linux and Windows is available. If you
        would like  to use the package on OS X, please let me know so we can
        work on a build system.
        
        ### Wheels
        Currently, wheels are provided for Windows. The Linux wheels are built
        with Travis-CI and are thus not `manylinux` wheels. Therefore, building
        yourself is recommended when using Linux (either from the source dist
        from PyPI or this repository). Feel free to open an issue if you
        encounter any problems building!
        
        ### Linux
        These instructions are for Ubuntu, Python 3.5 or higher. Any lower 
        version may work, but is not supported. On other distributions, package 
        names may be different.
        ```bash
        # Build Tools
        sudo apt install build-essential cmake
        # Required Libraries
        sudo apt install libgtk2.0-dev libglib2.0-dev tcl-dev tk-dev
        # Required Python packages
        python -m pip install scikit-build
        
        python setup.py install 
        ``` 
        
        ### Windows (64-bit only)
        These instructions assume you have [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
        installed, with the MinGW toolchain. The `setup.py` script will check
        the additional build dependencies and install them when required.
        
        Both the MSYS `bin` directory as well as the MinGW `bin` directory must
        be on the `PATH` to run the `setup.py` script. Usually, these folders
        are `C:\msys64\usr\bin` and `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin`, but they may differ
        for your installation.
        
        In addition to this, the `setup.py` script expects the `Dependencies` 
        program found [here](https://github.com/lucasg/Dependencies) to be 
        installed under `deps/Dependencies.exe` by default. This tool is used
        to find all DLL-files necessary to run `gttk` without any external files.
        
        If you have satisfied all requirements, assuming you want to install 
        the package *outside* of your MSYS installation:
        ```bash
        # Replace C:\Python with the path to your Python setup
        # The MSYS version of Python is on PATH and thus you should use an abspath!
        C:\Python\python.exe setup.py install
        ``` 
        
        The binary distribution of `gttk` will come with all DLL-files known to
        be required to run it. These DLL-files are generally available under
        their own specific licenses, as covered in the files that are found in
        the MSYS directory `/share/licenses`.
        
        ## Usage
        Simply import the package and instantiate the `GTTK` class. Then the 
        theme will become available for usage in a `ttk.Style`.
        ```python
        import tkinter as tk
        from tkinter import ttk
        from gttk import GTTK
        
        window = tk.Tk()
        gttk = GTTK(window)
        style = ttk.Style()
        style.theme_use("gttk")
        print(gttk.get_current_theme()) # Prints the active GTK theme
        gttk.set_gtk_theme("Yaru") # Sets GTK theme, provided by developer
        ttk.Button(window, text="Destroy", command=window.destroy).pack()
        
        window.mainloop()
        ```
        
        If you encounter an error because you are running in the repository, 
        directory, make sure to disallow imports from the working directory
        before importing `gttk`:
        ```python
        import sys
        sys.path = sys.path[2:]
        import gttk
        ```
        
        ## Screenshots
        `gttk` should work with any GTK theme you can throw at it, but below
        are the themes Yaru and Adwaita as examples.

        ## Project State
        `tile-gtk`, `gtkTtk` and hence also `gttk` are far from perfect. You may
        encounter various graphical artifacts when using particular themes,
        while others work without flaws.
        
        You are welcome to report any issues, and pull requests are even better.
        Currently the package can only be built for Linux-based systems and 
        attempts to create a process for building on Windows using MSYS and
        CMake have proven unfruitful. If you would like to give it a go, 
        feel free to contact me.
