# demand-manager
Demand manager is a python package for managing the loads of households, including electric appliances, batteries and EVs.

Demand manage uses the MiniZinc as the optimisation modelling language, and Gecode, Gurobi or other solvers that are compatible with MiniZinc. 

The objectives of the demand optimisation problem include the energy usage cost, the network charge (if needed) and inconvenience to consumers.
