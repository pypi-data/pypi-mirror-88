Description: 
        Statistical analysis tool to help identify molecular fragments that promote, or detract from,
        target properties.
        
        Sepecifically, this tool calculates the "z-scores" of molecular substructures in a given
        sub-population of a database to identify fragments that are over- or under-represented in this
        sub-population relative to a reference population. These substructures can either be specified
        by the user, or automatically generated using Morgan fingerprints.
