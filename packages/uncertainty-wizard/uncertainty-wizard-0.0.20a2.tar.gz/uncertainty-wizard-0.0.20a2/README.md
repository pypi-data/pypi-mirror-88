This library provides simple and transparent uncertainty and confidence quantification for 
fast-forward tensorflow.keras models.

Import `uncertainty_wizard as uwiz`, and you will amongst other things be able to do the following:
* Perform MC-Dropout using the Sequential API (`model=uwiz.models.StochasticSequential(my_layers)`) `
* Perform MC-Dropout on pre-trained models (`model=uwiz.models.stochastic_from_keras(your_model)`)
* Train Deep Ensembles in a memory and time efficient way with our lazily loaded and easily parallelized LazyEnsembles. (`model=uwiz.models.LazyEnsemble(path='model', num_models=20, default_num_processes=4`)

#### Installation

It's as easy as `pip install uncertainty-wizard`

#### Requirements
- tensorflow >= 2.2.0
- python 3.6* / 3.7 / 3.8

Note that **tensorflow 2.4** has just been released. 
We will test and create compatibility with uncertainty wizard in the next couple of weeks.
Until then, please stick to tensorflow 2.3.x.

*python 3.6 requires to `pip install dataclasses`

#### Documentation
A link to our documentation and user guide will be added here soon.

#### Examples
Our docs contain a list of jupyter based examples, which you can run in colab right away.
You can find them here: (Link will be added soon)

#### Authors and Paper
Uncertainty Wizard was developed at the Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana (USI) in Lugano
by Michael Weiss under the supervision of Prof. Paolo Tonella.
