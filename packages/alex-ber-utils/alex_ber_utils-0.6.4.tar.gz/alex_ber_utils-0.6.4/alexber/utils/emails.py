"""
This module contains extensions of the logging handlers.
See https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#module-logging.handlers for more details.

See here https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/my-emails-module-3ad36a4861c5 for documentation.
All handlers are thread safe.

It is better to use EmailStatus context manager with configured emailLogger.
See docstring of EmailStatus.

This module optionally depends on ymlparseser module.

If you want to change delimeters used to indicate variable declaration inside template, see docstring of the
OneMemoryHandler.get_subject() method.

            If this object is shared, see another options below.
        2. You can override this method and pass Jinja2 Environment object with threading.RLock (or any other lock)
        object in order to ensure atomic read of all decimetres.
        3. Call alexber.utils.ymplparser.initConfig() method to initialize HiYaPyCo.jinja2ctx (together will
        HiYaPyCo.jinja2Lock). It will be consulted for delimeters in format_template() method. Please, note:
            This object will be used by also by another modules (init_app_conf.py for example), so this change
            may effect also another parts of your applications if you use when.
            You're changing global variable, please make sure, you own code is aware of this change.
            You should ensure that dependencies that are required by ymplparser module are installed.

        (see below).

        If your application is stopped abruptly (for example, by SIGINT) and your buffer (in the current Thread)
        has some messages,
        logging system at shutdown will flush and close all handlers, so the buffer without message
