Description: # ebnf tools
        
        A collection of tools to work with ebnf grammars, like conversion between different formats, railroad generation and random example generation.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        Requires python3.9 or higher.
        
        Other requirements like `lark` and `railroad-diagrams` should be installed automatically by pip
        
        ### Installing
        
        `pip install ebnf`
        
        If you want to use one of the extra utils with extra requirements, use the `ebnf[<extra>]` syntax:
        
        - **railroad** diagram generation:
        `pip install ebnf[railroad]`
          
        ## Tools
        
        The 'base' ebnf dialect for this package the one used by the `lark` package. All features should work for it, but might not work for others.
        
        
        ### `ebnf.railroad` - railroad diagram generation
        
        Generates a html file containing svg for each rule/terminal in the input grammar. Can take a lot of different options, check the help for more info
        
        ### `ebnf.convert` - dialect translation (TODO)
        
        Attempts to convert between different dialects, with the focus being generation `lark` compatible output
        
        ### `ebnf.example` - generates an example for a grammar (TODO)
