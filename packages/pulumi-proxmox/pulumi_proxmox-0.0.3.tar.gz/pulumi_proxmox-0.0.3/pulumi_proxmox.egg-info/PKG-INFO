Description: # Pulumi Provider for Proxmox
        
        ![master branch status](https://github.com/ryan4yin/pulumi-proxmox/workflows/master/badge.svg)
        
        
        A Pulumi Provider which adds support for Proxmox solutions.
        
        based on [danitso/terraform-provider-proxmox](https://github.com/danitso/terraform-provider-proxmox), read its docs for details.
        
        
        ### Build the provider:
        
        
        In order to properly build the sdks, the following tools are expected:
        - `pulumictl` (See the project's README for installation instructions: https://github.com/pulumi/pulumictl)
        
        then use the following command to build all sdks:
        
        ```shell
        make build_sdks
        ```
        
        ## Installing
        
        This package is available in many languages in the standard packaging formats.
        
        first, build and install resource plugin, **this is necessary before you install any language's sdk**:
        
        ```shell
        make install_resource_plugin
        ```
        
        then install the language's sdks and every thing will be allright.
        
        **Note**: Installing package directly from the package registry like pypi/npm/nuget is not supported yet, you need to install package from source via `make`.
        
        
        ### Node.js (Java/TypeScript)
        
        ```shell
        make install_nodejs_sdk
        ```
        
        ### Python
        
        ```shell
        make install_python_sdk
        ```
        
        ### Go
        
        To use from Go, use `go get` to grab the latest version of the library
        
            $ go get github.com/ryan4yin/pulumi-proxmox/sdk/go/...
        
        
        ### .NET
        
        To use from .NET, use the following command:
        
            $ make install_dotnet_sdk
        
        ## Configuration
        
        >BUG: cannot read configuration from EnvVars `PROXMOX_VE_ENDPOINT` `PROXMOX_VE_USERNAME` etc.
        I'm Working on it now.
        
        In addition to [terraform generic provider arguments](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html) (e.g. `alias` and `version`), the following arguments are supported in the Proxmox `provider` block:
        
        * `virtual_environment` - (Optional) The Proxmox Virtual Environment configuration.
            * `endpoint` - (Required) The endpoint for the Proxmox Virtual Environment API (can also be sourced from `PROXMOX_VE_ENDPOINT`).
            * `insecure` - (Optional) Whether to skip the TLS verification step (can also be sourced from `PROXMOX_VE_INSECURE`). If omitted, defaults to `false`.
            * `otp` - (Optional) The one-time password for the Proxmox Virtual Environment API (can also be sourced from `PROXMOX_VE_OTP`).
            * `password` - (Required) The password for the Proxmox Virtual Environment API (can also be sourced from `PROXMOX_VE_PASSWORD`).
            * `username` - (Required) The username and realm for the Proxmox Virtual Environment API (can also be sourced from `PROXMOX_VE_USERNAME`).
        
        ## Reference
        
        please read [danitso/terraform-provider-proxmox](https://github.com/danitso/terraform-provider-proxmox)'s docs for details.
        
        ## Developing the Provider
        
        all information about sdks are configured in `provider/resources.go`, if you want to help me, take a look at it.
