        # aws-sso-cred-restore
        This is script is inspired from `aws2-wrap` and solve problem with old sdk's  like aws-sdk-go and turn safe our
        work with tools like terraform.
        
        ## the problem
        
        Work with terraform is more safe if we use only profile configuration and  work with `workspaces` feature.
        
        ```hcl
        provider "aws" {
        	 profile = "${terraform.env}"
        	 region  = "${var.region}"
        }
        ```
        
        But aws sso cli command cannot configure credentials file, and aws-sdk-go cannot work with new model of profile config.
        
        Using environment variables, the configuration overwrite profile option on provider block on terraform, and this is *dangerous*.
        
        This wrapper solve `temporary` (hello aws and hashicorp, solve this plis!!) this problem.
        
        
        ## Install using `pip`
        
        https://pypi.org/project/aws-sso-cred-restore
        
        `pip install aws-sso-cred-restore==<VERSION>`
        
        ## Run a command using AWS SSO credentials
        
        `aws-sso-cred-restore --profile <awsprofilename-or-prefix>`
        
        or run to all profiles in your config
        
        `aws-sso-cred-restore`
        
        This command will get credentials using active aws sso access key section file
        and restore in `~/.aws/credentials`
        
        
        ## Export the credentials
        
        There may be circumstances when it is easier/better to set the appropriate environment variables so that they can be re-used by any `aws` command.
        
        Since the script cannot directly set the environment variables in the calling shell process, it is necessary to use the following syntax:
        
        `eval "$(aws-sso-cred-restore --profile <awsprofilename-or-prefix> --export)"`
