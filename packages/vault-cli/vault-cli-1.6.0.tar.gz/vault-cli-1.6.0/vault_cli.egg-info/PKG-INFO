        ``vault-cli`` is a Python 3.6+ tool that offers simple interactions to manipulate
        secrets from `Hashicorp Vault`_. With ``vault-cli``, your secrets can be kept secret,
        while following `12-factor`__ principles.

        Some features
        -------------
        
        - Configure once, use everywhere thanks to cascading (local, user, global) YAML
          configuration file
        - Read, browse, write, move, delete secrets easily
        - Read multiple secrets at once, as YAML
        - Launch processes with your secrets as environment variables
        - Launch processes with ``ssh-agent`` configured from your vault
        - Write templated files with secrets inside
        - Combine multiple secrets into a single one (e.g. a DSN string from components)
        
        ``vault-cli`` tries to make accessing secrets both secure and painless.
