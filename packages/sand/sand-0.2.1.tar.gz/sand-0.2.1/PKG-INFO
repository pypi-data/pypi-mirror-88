        Python code and notebooks to model System Architecture as a Network of Dependencies
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        SAND uses Python and Jupyter Notebooks to explore applications of
        representing system architecture as a directed graph, or network, of
        engineered artifacts and their relationships to one another.
        
        Engineered artifacts are vertices in the graph. For a software library,
        the artifacts are functions and the dependencies are function calls. For
        RESTful microservices, an artifact is a service and the dependencies are
        API calls.
        
        Directed edges represent the dependencies and their transpose, impact.
        
        Imagine we have two microservices, A and B.
        
        If B calls A, then B has a dependency on A. The creator of A might not
        know that B is a client, so the dependency relationship is directed.
        
        The transpose of this relationship is that A impacts or influences B:
        Non backwards-compatible changes in A’s interface that B calls can break
        B. Changes in B do not impact A, so once again, the edge is directed.
        
        This simple model proves to be extremely powerful in describing
        arbitrarily complicated system architectures. The SAND library and
        accompanying Jupyter Notebooks provide working examples of visualization
        and analysis.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ``pip install sand``
        
        You might also want to clone this git repo to follow along with the
        examples below:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           git clone git@github.com:testedminds/sand.git
           cd sand
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        SAND is documented with a series of Jupyter Notebooks:
        
        -  `Loading Network Data <./docs/Loading%20network%20data.ipynb>`__
        -  `Matrix Visualization with
           Bokeh <./docs/Matrix%20visualization%20with%20Bokeh.ipynb>`__
        -  `Network Visualization with
           Cytoscape <./docs/Visualization%20with%20Cytoscape.ipynb>`__
        
        Running in Docker
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You can run these notebooks via Docker to experiment. Assuming you have
        a ``docker-machine`` running and you’ve cloned the ``sand`` repo:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           git clone git@github.com:testedminds/sand.git
           docker pull testedminds/sand
           make docker-docs
           # And after the container starts...
           make docker-open
        
        When the notebook opens in your browser, you will see the Notebook
        Dashboard, which will show a list of the notebooks and data in the
        ``docs`` directory.
        
        These commands translate to:
        
        ::
        
           docker run -d -p 80:8888 -v `pwd`/docs:/opt/sand --rm --name sand testedminds/sand:latest \
                           jupyter notebook --allow-root --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --NotebookApp.token=''
        
           open http://192.168.99.100
        
        This is a useful technique to quickly explore network data anywhere on
        your local filesystem.
        
        Running locally
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To run the notebooks locally without Docker:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           pip install -r requirements.txt
           cd docs
           jupyter notebook
        
        -  `Install Cytoscape <http://cytoscape.org/>`__ to run the optional
           Cytoscape examples. Start Cytoscape up and close the welcome screen.
           You probably want to check “Don’t show again” in the lower left.

        for a more detailed introduction to the concept.
        
        The Notebooks leverage `Cytoscape’s RESTful
        API <http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/cyrest>`__ and
        `python-igraph <http://igraph.org/python/>`__.
