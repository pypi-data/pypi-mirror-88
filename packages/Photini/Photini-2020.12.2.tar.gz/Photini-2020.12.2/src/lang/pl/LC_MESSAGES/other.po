"There are several ways to install Photini. On Windows you can use an all-"
"in-one installer or you can use MSYS2_. On some Linux distributions you "
"might be able to use your package manager to install everything. On other"
" platforms you need to install several dependencies before installing "
"Photini."
msgstr ""

msgid "All-in-one installer (Windows)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Windows installers create a stand-alone MSYS2_ installation with all "
"the dependencies needed to run Photini. This is a minimal MSYS2 and "
"Python system, and should not conflict with any other Python version "
"installed on your computer, or any other MSYS2 installation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Previous installers (from before May 2019) used a \"portable Python\" "
"system based on WinPython_. If you have a Photini installation from one "
"of these installers you should remove it using the \"Programs and "
"Features\" control panel item, and ensure the installation folder (e.g. "
"``C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Photini`` has been removed, before using the "
"new installer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can download the Windows installers from the GitHub `Windows "
"installers`_ page. These install the latest version of Photini, even if "
"the installer is older. There are installers for 32 bit and 64 bit "
"Windows, and they should work on any version since Windows XP."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you run the installer you will probably get a security warning "
"because the installer is not signed by a recognised authority. This is "
"unavoidable unless I purchase a certificate with which to sign the "
"installer. As I don't make any money from Photini this is unlikely to "
"happen!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The installer should finish by running the Photini program. If this works"
" then you have successfully installed Photini and can ignore the rest of "
"these instructions. If not, see the troubleshooting_ section below."
msgstr ""

msgid "Upgrading all-in-one installation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before upgrading Photini you should check the `Windows installers`_ page "
"to see if a new Windows installer has been released since you last "
"downloaded it. If there is a new installer available then you should use "
"it to create a fresh installation, after using the \"Programs and "
"Features\" control panel item to uninstall the old version of Photini."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To upgrade an existing installation you need to run an MSYS2_ \"command "
"shell\". Open the folder where Photini is installed (probably "
"``C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Photini``) and run the ``mingw64.exe`` program"
" in the ``msys2`` folder (use ``mingw32.exe`` if you have a 32-bit "
"installation). This program needs to be run as administrator. Then follow"
" the instructions in :ref:`upgrading MSYS2 installation <upgrading-"
"msys2>` below."
msgstr ""

msgid "MSYS2 (Windows)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An alternative to the Windows standalone installer is to use a full "
"installation of MSYS2_. This is not that difficult to do, but will need "
"almost 3 GBytes of disc space, and half an hour of your time. Installing "
"Photini this way ensures its dependencies are up to date and should be "
"easier to update in future."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following instructions assume you are using 64-bit Windows. If you "
"are on a 32-bit machine you'll need to install the 32-bit (``i686`` "
"instead of ``x86_64``) versions of everything. Note that the 32-bit "
"version of MSYS2_ is no longer supported."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First install MSYS2_ and update the packages as described on the MSYS2 "
"homepage. You do not need to install it as ``C:\\msys64``, but you "
"probably should avoid using spaces in the directory name. You should also"
" avoid installing in ``C:\\Program Files`` or ``C:\\Program Files (x86)``"
" so you don't have to use administrator privileges to make any changes. "
"Run the ``C:\\msys64\\mingw64.exe`` shell and use pacman_ to install "
"Photini's dependencies::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This will take some time as over 300 MByte will be downloaded. (The Qt "

msgid "Words with special meanings"

msgid ""
"Some of Photini's GUI elements such as ``Title / Object Name`` are named "

msgstr ""

msgid "Formatting strings"

msgid ""
"In Python curly braces are used to include other data in a string. For "

"year and copyright holder's name when the program is run. You should take"

" it's appropriate for your language."
msgstr ""

msgid "Carriage returns"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some of Photini's buttons split their labels over two or more lines to "

msgid "HTML markup"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Strings such as ``<h3>Upload to Flickr has not finished.</h3>`` include "
"HTML markup which must be copied to your translated string. The Transifex"
" web page includes a \"copy source string\" button that can help with "
"this. Some strings such as ``<multiple values>`` are not HTML. The angle "
"brackets ``<>`` are used to indicate data with a special meaning. These "
"strings should usually be translated."
msgstr ""

msgid "Keyboard shortcuts"
msgstr ""

msgid "Plural forms"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Translations can accommodate the many ways that languages handle plurals."
" For example in English we write \"0 files, 1 file, 2 files\". Transifex_"
" has small buttons to select the quantity the translation applies to. "
"Other translation editors should also handle plural forms."
msgstr ""
