msgid "Location addresses"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Address`` tab shows text address data for the location from where "
"the photograph was taken (``camera``) and one or more locations shown in "
"the photograph (``subject``). For example, a general view of the Eiffel "
"Tower will almost certainly have been taken from somewhere else in Paris."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These are stored in a 5-level hierarchy: ``street``, ``city``, "
"``province``, ``country`` and ``region``. The meaning of these terms is "
"rather loose, especially when out in the countryside, and there's no "
"requirement to fill them all in. Typically ``city`` can be anything from "
"a village to a metropolis, and ``street`` is a more specific location, "
"e.g. \"23 Abdication Avenue\". ``Province`` would be a state in the USA "
"or a county in the UK. ``Country`` is stored as a name and a 2 or 3 "
"letter ISO code. ``Region`` appears to be rarely used but could be a "
"continent or sub-continent. More detail about these can be found on the "
"`IPTC web site "
"<https://www.iptc.org/std/photometadata/documentation/userguide/index.htm#!Documents/locations.htm>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The separation of camera and subject addresses was added to the IPTC "
"specification in 2009, but you may still have software that only "
"recognises \"legacy\" address metadata. In this case you should not use "
"the ``subject`` tabs or ``region`` field. (Note that although the address"
" metadata is standardised by the IPTC, it's actually stored in the XMP "
"data.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Get address from lat, long`` button uses \"reverse geocoding\" to "
"convert latitude & longitude into a hierarchical address. This is a "
"rather imprecise process so you may need to edit the results yourself. "
"The address lookup service is provided by OpenCage_, using data from "
"OpenStreetMap_. Other map providers don't allow lookup results to be "
"permanently stored."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Photini attempts to use all the data returned in an address lookup. This "
"can lead to some duplication, e.g. Château-Gontier appears in both city "
"and province."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is usually necessary to edit the address quite a lot."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Right-clicking on a location tab displays a context menu that allows the "
"tab to be copied to a new tab or deleted. Copying the ``camera`` location"
" is an easy way to initialise a ``subject`` location. (An empty ``subject"
" 2`` tab is immediately created, in case the photograph has more than one"
" subject.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this case most of the data is the same, but I changed the ``street`` "
"to the subject of the photograph rather than the place where I was "
"standing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To reorder the subject locations, or to convert between camera and "
"subject, you can drag any of the tabs to another position. If this "
"results in the rightmost tab having data then another tab will be added. "
"If the two rightmost tabs have no data then one of the empty tabs will be"
" removed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Comments or questions? Please subscribe to the Photini mailing list "
"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/photini and let us know."
msgstr ""

msgid "Configuration"
msgstr "Konfiguracja"

msgid ""
"If there are tabs in the Photini GUI that you don't use, you can remove "
"them by deselecting their entry in the ``Options`` menu."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Options`` menu also has a ``Settings`` item which opens the dialog "
"shown below."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The top three items can be used to adjust the auto-generated copyright "
"and creator fields on the descriptive metadata tab. The ``copyright "
"text`` entry has place-holders where the photograph's \"taken\" year and "
"the copyright holder's name are inserted. You might want to change the "
"surrounding text to suit the law in your country, or even to make your "
"photographs rights free if you like."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The next items adjust how Photini uses \"sidecar\" files and IPTC "
"metadata. The `Metadata Working Group`_ recommended that IPTC metadata is"
" not written to files unless already present. Photini has an option to "
"always write IPTC metadata. You may need this if you use some other "
"software that reads IPTC but not Exif or XMP."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sidecar files allow metadata to be stored without needing to write to the"
" actual image file. If you deselect \"write to image file\" then sidecars"
" will always be created. Otherwise, you can choose to have them always "
"created (storing data in parallel with the image file), only created when"
" necessary (e.g. an image file is write protected), or deleted when "
"possible (if metadata can be copied to the image file the sidecar is "
"deleted)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally there is an option to preserve file timestamps. This allows "
"Photini to write metadata to an image file without changing the file's "
"\"modification time\" as displayed in a file browser. You may find this "
"useful if you often use a browser to sort files by date."
msgstr ""

msgid "Spell checking"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Spelling`` menu allows you to enable or disable spell checking on "
"Photini's text fields, and to select the language dictionary to use. The "
"available languages depend on what dictionaries you have installed. "
"Adding extra languages on Linux is easy -- just use your system's package"
" manager to install the appropriate Aspell or Hunspell dictionary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Windows programs don't share spell checking dictionaries as easily as on "
"Linux. You may be able to find a suitable dictionary to download "
"directly. There is a list of Aspell dictionaries at "
"ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell/dict/0index.html that might help. Installing"
" these may not be easy. You'll need to run a command shell as described "
"in :doc:`../other/installation`. The ``tar.bz2`` files can be unpacked "
"with the ``bsdtar`` command, for example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then you may need to compile the dictionary before installing it. There "
"should be instructions provided with the dictionary. In this case I "
"needed to install ``make`` and edit the ``Makefile`` to change the "
"Windows paths to simpler Linux-like ones. As a last resort you can try "
"copying the files to the dictionary folder ``/mingw64/lib/aspell-0.60``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Configuration file location"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Photini stores its configuration in a file called ``editor.ini``. The "
"default location of this file is ``$HOME/.config/photini/`` (Linux) or "
"``%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\photini\\`` (Windows). If you'd like to "
"store it elsewhere (e.g. on a networked drive so you can share "
"configuration between several computers) you can set an environment "
"variable ``PHOTINI_CONFIG`` to the directory you'd like to use."
msgstr ""

msgid "PyQt options"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The configuration file includes options to force use of PyQt4 instead of "
"PyQt5 or PySide2, and use of QtWebKit instead of QtWebEngine. These may "
"be useful if one of these components on your computer is incompatible "
"with Photini. There are so many versions of PyQt that it is impossible to"
" test Photini with every one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default options in the configuration file are in the ``[pyqt]`` "
"section:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To force use of PyQt4 set the values of ``using_pyqt5`` and "
"``using_pyside2`` to ``False``. To force use of PySide2 set the value of "
"``using_pyside2`` to ``True``. To force the use of QtWebKit set the value"
" of ``using_qtwebengine`` to ``False``. You can check which versions "
"Photini is currently using by running it in a command window with the "
"``--version`` option::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Setting the ``native_dialog`` option to ``False`` makes Photini use a Qt "
"dialog to select files to open instead of the normal operating system "
"dialog."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that there is no GUI to set these options. You may need to adjust "
"them if Photini crashes on startup, in which case the GUI would be "
"unusable. The configuration file can be edited with any plain text "
"editing program."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make sure your editor doesn't change the file's encoding (e.g. from utf-8"
" to iso-8859) or insert a \"byte order mark\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "Application style"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Qt applications can have their appearance changed by selecting different "
"\"styles\". Normally a style is automatically chosen that suits the "
"operating system, but you may want to override this if you prefer "
"something different. For example, on one of my computers the default "
"style doesn't draw lines round the grouped elements on the uploader tabs,"
" so I change the style to one that does."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The choice of style affects how some \"widgets\" are drawn. If you find "
"problems such as date or timezone values (on the \"technical metadata\" "
"tab) being partly hidden then it might be worth trying another style."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To find out what styles are available on your computer you can use "
"Photini's ``--version`` flag. (You need to run Photini from a command "
"window to do this, see the :ref:`installation troubleshooting"
"<installation-troubleshooting>` section.) You can then try one of these "
"styles as follows::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the style names are not case sensitive. If none of the "
"available styles is to your liking you may be able to install extra ones."
" For example, on some Ubuntu Linux systems the package ``qt5-style-"
"plugins`` is available."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you find a style that you like, you can set Photini to use that "
"style by editing the configuration file as described above. Add a line "
"such as ``style = breeze`` to the ``[pyqt]`` section to set your chosen "
"style. Note that after doing this you can not set a different style on "
"the command line unless you remove the ``style = ...`` line from your "
"config file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tab order"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Photini's tabs can be enabled or disabled with the ``Options`` menu as "
"described above, but their order is set in the configuration file. The "
"``[tabs]`` section has a ``modules`` entry which lists the modules to be "
"imported for each tab. You can reorder the tabs by reordering this list."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You could even use a tab provided by another Python package by adding its"
" module name to the list. See :doc:`extending` for more information."
msgstr ""

msgid "Descriptive metadata"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Descriptive metadata`` tab (keyboard shortcut ``Alt+D``) allows you"
" to edit basic information about your photographs, such as the title and "
"description."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first thing I usually do with a new set of photographs is to set the "
"copyright and creator/artist metadata. Select all the images (keyboard "
"shortcut ``Ctrl+A``) then click on the ``Auto`` button next to the "
"``Copyright`` text entry box. The first time you do this Photini asks you"
" to provide the name of the copyright holder. This should probably be "
"your name, but could be the name of a company. Type in the name and click"
" ``OK``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Auto`` button generates a standard copyright notice. If you prefer "
"a different wording you can change the template, as described in "
":doc:`configuration <configuration>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next click on the ``Creator / Artist`` field's ``Auto`` button. Now "
"Photini will ask for the name of the creator. Edit the name if required, "
"then click ``OK``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that all the image thumbnails now have a warning symbol (|hazard|) "
"displayed next to them. This shows that they have unsaved metadata edits."
" The ``File`` menu ``Save images with new data`` item (keyboard shortcut "
"``Ctrl+S``) saves your edits and clears the warning symbols, as shown "
"below. I do this frequently to avoid losing any of my work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next I set the title. Select all the images that should have the same "
"title, then type the title in the ``Title / Object name`` text editing "
"box. Note that the title (and keywords) are stored in XMP but not in "
"Exif, so may not be visible to software that only handles Exif metadata "
"(see :doc:`tag reference <tags>` for more detail). You may prefer to "
"leave the title and keywords fields blank."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Title / Object name`` field has an optional spell checker, enabled "
"with the ``Spelling`` menu. The word \"Château-Gontier\" is not in the "
"British English dictionary, as indicated by the red underlining. Right-"
"clicking on a misspelled word shows a list of suggested alternatives, one"
" of which can be chosen by clicking on it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now you can add more detail in the ``Description / Caption`` box. There "
"are probably only one or two photographs that share the same description,"
" so select those images first."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you select a group of images you may see ``<multiple values>`` "
"displayed in some of the text boxes. You can right-click on the box to "
"bring up a context menu from which you can choose a value to be copied to"
" all the selected photographs. In this case there is only one choice as "
"one photo has a description and the other does not."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Next you can set a list of keywords for the image by typing them in the "
"``Keywords`` box. Keywords should be separated by semi-colon (;) "
"characters. The ``<favourites>`` drop-down list can be used to select "
"keywords from the ones you use most often."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally the ``Rating`` slider allows you to note any particularly good or"
" bad pictures. Good pictures can be given a one to five star rating."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Bad pictures can be given a ``reject`` rating. This is stored in the "
"metadata as a rating value of -1."
msgstr ""

msgid "Extending Photini"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is possible to add new functionality to Photini by providing a new "
"\"tab\". Because the tabs are loaded dynamically at run-time the new tab "
"does not need to be part of the Photini Python package. For example, if "
"the package ``mypackage`` provides a Photini tab in the module "
"``mypackage.photini``, then adding ``mypackage.photini`` to the tab "
"modules list (see :ref:`configuration-tabs`) will add the tab to Photini."
msgstr ""

msgid "Every Photini tab has to have the following interface:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``tab_name`` method returns the label given to the tab. It should be "
"as short as possible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the user defines any new metadata you should get the current "
"selection from the ``image_list`` and set the metadata on every image in "
"the selection."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's probably easiest to start with a copy of the Photini tab module most"
" like what you want to do, strip out the bits you don't need and then add"
" your own stuff."
msgstr ""

msgid "Flickr uploader"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Flickr upload`` tab (keyboard shortcut ``Alt+F``) allows you to "
"upload your photographs to `Flickr <http://www.flickr.com/>`_. Flickr is "
"a popular online photograph sharing service. The Flickr upload tab uses "
"the Flickr API but is not endorsed or certified by Flickr."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike some other Flickr uploaders, Photini uses the descriptive metadata"
" you've created to set Flickr's title, description and tags. This means "
"you don't have to retype all that information!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the Flickr upload tab is only enabled if you have installed "
"some extra software packages. See :ref:`installation <installation-"
"optional>` for more detail."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Initially most of the Flickr uploader tab is disabled. It's only usable "
"after you've authorised Photini to access your Flickr account by clicking"
" the ``Log in`` button."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first time you click ``Log in`` Photini connects your web browser to "
"Flickr, from where you can log in and give Photini permission to access "
"Flickr on your behalf."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In January 2020 Flickr introduced a bug in the authorisation process. "
"They are changing the \"callback URL\" from HTTP to HTTPS, which causes "
"an error like the one shown above. (Other browsers may show a different "
"error.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The workaround is to click on the browser's URL display, change \"https\""
" to \"http\", then hit the return key."
msgstr ""

msgid "The web browser window can then be closed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the authorisation is successful Photini displays your Flickr user name"
" and profile picture. You should not need to redo this authorisation "
"process unless you click the ``Log out`` button."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Your current Flickr albums are shown on the right hand side of the Flickr"
" uploader tab. You can add a new album with the ``New album`` button. "
"This opens a pop-up dialog as shown below."

"Type in the album details and click ``OK``. Note that the album will not "
"be created on Flickr until you upload a photo to it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To upload one or more photographs to Flickr, select them in the image "
"selector area, then choose which (if any) of your albums to add them to "
"and set any of the other attributes, then click on the ``Start upload`` "
"button."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During uploading Photini displays a progress bar. Uploading takes place "
"in the background, so you can continue to use other tabs while the upload"
" is in progress. The upload can be stopped by clicking the ``Stop "
"upload`` button."
msgstr ""

msgid "After uploading a photograph it is marked as having new metadata."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you switch to the ``Descriptive metadata`` tab you can see there is a "
"new keyword ``flickr:photo_id=11-digit-number``. Photini uses this "
"`triple tag`_ to store the Flickr photo id so it can be used to "
"synchronise metadata later on, as described below."
msgstr ""

msgid "Synchronising local metadata to Flickr"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sometimes you might change your photograph's metadata on Flickr and would"

"Select the image(s) you would like to update and click the "
"``Synchronise`` button."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If an image does not have a ``flickr:photo_id`` keyword then Photini will"
" try to find the photograph on Flickr by matching the date and time it "
"was taken. If there is new metadata on Flickr then it is merged into the "
"image's metadata."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can see what changed with the image's context menu ``View changes``. "
"In this case Flickr has set its location city to \"Chateau-Gontier\" "

"upload`` button."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you upload an image that already has a ``flickr:photo_id`` keyword "

msgstr ""

msgid "Google Photos uploader"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Google Photos upload`` tab (keyboard shortcut ``Alt+P``) allows you"
" to upload your photographs to `Google Photos`_. The Google Photos API is"
