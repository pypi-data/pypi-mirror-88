TO DO
======================
 
- Fix etopo plotting and put dependencies into setup.py
    - Otherwise, sample file won't work without bath file
     
- Put actions on map in small text      

- Add restructured text -> html

- could make event and station into classes (and events? params? table? map?)

- Allow arbitrarily long station names (or at least up to 10-15 chars),
  adapting the restructuredText table columns as needed

Use `reStructuredText
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ to modify this file.
