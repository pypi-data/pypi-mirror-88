Description: PYthon LOCKER or pylocker package provides a pythonic way to create 
        locking mechanism that can be used for general purposes as well as 
        for locking files upon reading or writing. 
        The locking system works by creating and updating a general locking 
        file anytime a lock is requested with a certain pass. Lock pass is 
        used to specify the user who sets the lock and who can have access 
        to whatever is locked. Any user who knows the lock pass can access 
        whatever is locked.
