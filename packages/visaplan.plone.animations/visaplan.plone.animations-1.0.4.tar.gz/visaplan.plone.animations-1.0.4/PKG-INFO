        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        1.1 (unreleased)
        ----------------
        
        - CreateJS-based "Type 2", using `class` instead of `id` attributes
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.0.4 (2020-12-16)
        ------------------
        
        Improvements:
        
        - Made FolderishAnimations clickable even if lacking a preview image
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.0.3 (2020-03-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Views for AJAX navigation support (based on visaplan.plone.ajaxnavigation_)
        - Added an ``ajax-nav`` view to prevent Plone from trying to load a FolderishAnimation via AJAX
          (since this doesn't work yet).
        - Since it is not usable as an AJAX navigation target,
          the ``embed`` view has been renamed to ``onlyme``
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.0.2 (2019-10-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Removed profile dependency on visaplan.plone.behaviors, since the current version 1.0.2 doesn't have one.
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.0.1 (2019-06-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Support for preloader images, recognized by name

        - Add CSS classes to HTML text
