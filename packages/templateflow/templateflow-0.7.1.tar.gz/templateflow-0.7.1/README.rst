A Python client to query TemplateFlow
=====================================

Group inference and reporting of neuroimaging studies require that
individual’s features are spatially aligned into a common frame where
their location can be called standard. To that end, a multiplicity of
brain templates with anatomical annotations (i.e., atlases) have been
published. However, a centralized resource that allows programmatic
access to templates is lacking. TemplateFlow is a modular,
version-controlled resource that allows researchers to use templates
“off-the-shelf” and share new ones.
