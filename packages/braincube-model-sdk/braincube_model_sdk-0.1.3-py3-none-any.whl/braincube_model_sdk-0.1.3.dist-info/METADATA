# Braincube Model SDK

This Python package aims to provide the skeletton of the Braincube Model Manager framework.

This SDK provides the following classes and methods:

- class `Handler`: this class is to be inherited by the user to get notified when a message arrives, and to be able to send messages back to the Edge computing platform.
- function `run_sdk(handler)`: blocking function that your client should call at some point (earliest possible)
- function `stop_sdk`: will ask the sdk to stop itself. Not normally needed but if you need to stop the client at some point (and restart it later), you can use that.
