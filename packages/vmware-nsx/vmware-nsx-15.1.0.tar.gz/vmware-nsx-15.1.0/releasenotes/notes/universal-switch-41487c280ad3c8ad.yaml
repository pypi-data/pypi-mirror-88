features:
    The NSX-v universal transport zone can be used in order to create universal
    switches as VXLAN networks over all the nsx managers. For this option to be
    enabled, the vdn_scope_id parameter in nsx.ini should be set to the ID of
    the universal transport zone which is 'universalvdnscope'.
