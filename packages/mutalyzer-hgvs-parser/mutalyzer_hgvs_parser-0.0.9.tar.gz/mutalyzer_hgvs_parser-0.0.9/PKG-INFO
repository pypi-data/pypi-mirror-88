Description: # Mutalyzer HGVS Parser
        
        Package to parse HGVS variant descriptions and to convert them into a
        dictionary model.
        
        It includes the original Mutalyzer `pyparsing` based implementation, for which
        the EBNF grammar is written directly in Python, as well as the `lark` based
        approach, which accepts the grammar written using the EBNF notation in a
        separate file.
