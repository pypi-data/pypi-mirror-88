        ====================
        
        General tools modules for Plone_.
        
        We don't claim ultimate Plone wisdom (yet);
        this package is one of the parts a big monolithic classic Zope product
        was split into.
        
        It is part of the footing of the "Unitracc family" of Plone sites
        which are maintained by `visaplan GmbH`_, Bochum, Germany.
        
        Some modules of this package might still contain some resources
        (e.g. type names)
        which are specific to our "Unitracc family" of sites;
        this is likely to change in future releases.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        This add-on can be seen in action at the following sites:
        
        - https://www.unitracc.de
        - https://www.unitracc.com
        
        Modules in version 1.1.4+:
        
        - ``attools`` module
        
          several tools for Archetypes-based content
        
        - ``brains`` module
        
          currently one ``make_collector`` function, e.g. for address fields
        
        - ``cfg`` module
        
          Read "product" configuration, and detect development mode
        
        - ``context`` module
        
          Several tools for processing the request.
          Some need some modernization ...
        
        - ``forms`` module
        
          Several tools for forms
        
        - ``functions`` module
        
          Some functions, e.g. ``is_uid_shaped``
        
        - ``indexes`` module (new in v1.1.4) 
        
          - Function ``getSortableTitle`` for title conversion.
        
            This converts umlauts etc. to sort them
            as equal to their corresponding base vocals,
            according to German lexical usage.
        
        - ``log`` module
        
          Automatically named loggers
        
        - ``mock`` module
        
          - a few small classes for use in doctests
        
          - the same module as ``visaplan.tools.mock``
        
        - ``mock_cfg`` module
        
          A rudimentary mock module for ``cfg``
        
        - ``search`` module
        
          A few functions to support creation of ZODB catalog search queries
          (quite proprietary, I'm afraid; might go away in future versions)
        
        - ``setup`` module (since v1.1)
        
          Functions for use in migration scripts
        
        - ``zcmlgen`` module (since v1.1.1)
        
          - Generates ``configure.zcml`` files, if
        
            - changes are detected, and
        
            - development mode is active, and
        
            - the source is in an development package.
        
        - ``decorators`` module (since v1.1.6)
        
          - ``@returns_json``:
        
            Wraps the function call and returns the JSON_-encoded result,
            including HTTP headers.
        
            Uses simplejson_ if available.
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Sorry, we don't have real user documentation yet.
        
        Most functions are documented by doctests, anyway;
        it helps to understand some German.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Since ``visaplan.plone.tools`` is a package for Plone instances,
        it is not normally installed using ``pip``;
        instead, install it by adding it to your buildout::
        
            [buildout]
        
            ...
        
            eggs =
                visaplan.plone.tools
        
        
        and then running ``bin/buildout``

        ============
        
        - Tobias Herp, tobias.herp@visaplan.com
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        
        2.0.0 (unreleased)
        ------------------
        
        - Breaking changes:
        
          - ``forms.tryagain_url``:
        
            - all options (which are all arguments except the request)
              will `need to` be given by name
              (which is possible and `recommended already`).
        
        
        1.3.0 (2020-12-16)
        ------------------
        
        New Features:
        
        - New module ``groups``
        
        - New `.context` functions
        
          - `getMessenger` (factory):
        
            creates a `message` function which doesn't require
            (nor accept) a `context` argument
        
          - `getPath`
          - `get_parent`
          - `parents`
          - `parent_brains`
          - `make_brainGetter`
          - `make_pathByUIDGetter`
          - `make_translator`
          - `get_published_templateid`
          - `getSupportedLanguageTuples`
        
        - New function ``setup.safe_context_id``
        
        - New function ``search.normalizeQueryString`` (unicode, asterisks)
        
        - `POSKeyError` rescue facility, *for now* provided here:
        
          Inspired by the  five.grok_-based ``@@fix-blobs`` view by Mikko Ohtamaa,
          we have two views:
        
          - ``@@check-blobs`` scans the site object tree for
            (Archetypes or Dexterity) objects with broken BLOB attachments
            (images or files) and shows them in an HTML list with checkboxes;
        
          - ``@@check-blobs-delete-selected`` allows to delete the objects
            found be be affected.
        
          *Note:* this functionality will likely be moved to a dedicated add-on package;
          don't rely on it to exist in *any* other release of this package!
        
        - Optional functionality, depending on
        
          - visaplan.plone.search v1.2.1+
          - visaplan.plone.subportals
        
          (both currently not yet on PyPI)
        
        Improvements:
        
        - ``setup`` module:
        
          - If the ``reindex`` function, which was created by the ``make_reindexer`` factory,
            was given an object both by `brain` and by itself, it compared those two by identity,
            which wouldn't ever match.  Now checking for equality.
        
          - New function ``clone_tree`` (from release 1.2.0) now works recursively
        
          - When ``clone_tree`` moves objects from one folder to another, it tries to preserve a useful order;
            both functions ``_clone_tree_inner`` and ``_move_objects`` use the new helper ``apply_move_order_options``
            to inject a ``sort_on`` key into the query.
        
        - ``context`` module:
        
          - ``message`` function (non-generated; with `context` argument):
        
            The default `mapping` is `None` now.
        
          - `make_permissionChecker` doesn't require the ``checkperm``
            adapter any more to be useful
        
          - `make_userdetector` doesn't require the ``auth``
            adapter any more to be useful
        
        - Working doctests for ``search`` module
        
        - ``zcmlgen`` module:
        
          - "Constructors" of the generator classes support an optional `skip` argument
            (keyword-only)
        
        Hard dependencies removed:
        
        - Products.Archetypes_
        
          if it is not installed, parts of the `.attools` module simply won't work
        
        - visaplan.kitchen_
        
        - visaplan.plone.infohubs_
        
          If not installed, `.forms.form_changes` *requires* a `form` argument
          (but it is a stub anyway).

        1.2.0 (2020-05-13)
        ------------------
        
        New utilities:
        
        - ``setup`` module:
        
          - New function ``clone_tree``, using
          - function factory ``make_object_getter``
            and
          - function factory ``make_subfolder_creator``
        
          Both factories have overlapping functionality and might become unified in a future version;
          their initial purposes were:
        
          ``make_object_getter`` creates a function (usually called ``get_object``)
          which tries to *find* a (possibly moved and/or renamed) object,
          and then is able to apply a few changes;
        
          ``make_subfolder_creator`` creates a function (usually called ``new_folder``)
          which creates a new *folder* (unless already present),
          and then is able to apply a few changes.

          - ``@returns_json``
            (uses simplejson_ if available)
        
        New utilities:
        
        - ``context`` module:
        
          - function factory ``make_timeformatter``

        ------------------
        
        Bugfixes:

        - Missing requirements:
        
          - visaplan.kitchen_
        
        [tobiasherp]

        - ``indexes`` module added:
        
          - Function ``getSortableTitle`` for title conversion.
        
            This converts umlauts etc. to sort them
            as equal to their corresponding base vocals,
            according to German lexical usage.
        
        - ``attools`` module:
        
          - New function ``notifyedit(context)``
        
        - ``forms`` module:
        
          - ``tryagain_url`` function supports ``var_items`` argument
        
          - bugfix for ``make_input`` function (suppression of ``type`` attribute)
        
        - ``zcmlgen`` module:
        
          - changes detection improved to explicitly ignore added/removed blank lines
        
        - ``context`` module:
        
          - new functions ``message`` and ``getbrain``,

        [tobiasherp]

        ------------------
        
        - ``setup.make_renamer()``: generated ``rename`` function improved:
          existing positional options default to ``None``; instead of ``uid``,
          ``o`` (object) or ``brain`` can be specified (by name).
        
        - ``setup.make_query_extractor()``, generated ``extract_query`` function improved:
          don't convert a ``Language`` string to a list if it's value is ``all``
        
        - ``zcmlgen`` module:
        
          - Bugfix for changes detection
        
          - If changes are found but disallowed (non-development setup),
            and if ``sys.stdout`` is connected to a terminal,
            start the debugger
