# pyadtpulse - Python interface for ADT Pulse

Python client interface to the ADT Pulse security system.

While two or three Python clients to ADT Pulse existed, they generally only provided
arm/disarm support and none provided support for ADT Pulse when multiple sites existed
under a single account. This attempts to provide APIs to both all the zones (motion 
sensors, door sensors, etc) as well as arming and disarming individual sites.

NOTE: Since this interacts with the unofficial ADT Pulse AJAX web service, the
behavior is subject to change by ADT without notice.

## Installation

```
pip3 install pyadtpulse
```

## Usage

Since ADT Pulse automatically logs out other sessions accessing the same account, a best practice is
to **create a new username/password combination for each client** accessing ADT Pulse.

Additionally, since pyadtpulse currently does not support multiple sites (premises/locations), a
simple approach is to create a separate username/password for each site and configured such that
the username only has access to ONE site. This ensures that clients are always interacting with
that one site (and not accidentally with another site location).

#### Notes

* any changes to the name/count of sites are not automatically updated for existing site objects 

## Examples

```python
adt = PyADTPulse(username, password)

for site in adt.sites:
    site.status
    site.zones

    site.disarm()
    site.arm_away()
```

See [example-client.py](example-client.py) for a working example.

## Future Enhancements

Feature ideas, but no plans to implement:

* support OFFLINE status checking
* support multiple sites (premises/locations) under a single ADT account
* implement lightweight status pings to check if cache needs to be invalidated (every 5 seconds) (https://portal.adtpulse.com/myhome/16.0.0-131/Ajax/SyncCheckServ?t=1568950496392)
