NeutronPy
=========

NeutronPy is a python library with commonly used tools for neutron scattering measurements, primarily for Triple Axis Spectrometer data, but easily applied to other types of data, including some *reduced* Time of Flight data. Below is a non-exhaustive list of Neutronpy's features:

    * Triple Axis Spectrometer resolution function calculation (Translated from ResLib), including
        * Resolution ellipses
        * Instrument visualization
        * Convolution
    * Time of Flight Spectrometer resolution function calculation (based on Violini et al `doi:10.1016/j.nima.2013.10.042 <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2013.10.042>`_ ), including
        * Resolution ellipses
    * Structure factor calculation, including
        * Structure factors with support for
            * Mass Normalization
            * Debye-Waller factor
            * Unit cell visualization
        * Single-ion magnetic form factor calculation
    * Least-Squares fitting (custom interface for scipy.optimize.leastsq using lmfit features), including
        * Built-in physical models
    * Basic data operations
        * Binning
        * Normalization (time/monitor)
        * Calculated peak integrated intensity, position, and width
        * Plotting
        * Slicing
    * Loading from common TAS file types, including
        * SPICE
        * ICE
        * ICP
        * MAD


See `Roadmap <https://github.com/neutronpy/neutronpy/wiki/Roadmap>`_ for panned future features.

David M Fobes started development of NeutronPy while in the `Neutron Scattering Group <http://neutrons.phy.bnl.gov/>`_, part of the Condensed Matter Physics & Materials Science Department (CMPMSD) at `Brookhaven National Laboratory <http://www.bnl.gov/>`_, and has continued within the `MPA-CMMS <http://www.lanl.gov/org/padste/adeps/materials-physics-applications/condensed-matter-magnet-science>`_ and A-1 groups of `Los Alamos National Laboratory <http://www.lanl.gov/>`_. Both are `US Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences <http://science.energy.gov/bes/>`_ funded laboratories.

NeutronPy is a work-in-progress (see the `Roadmap <https://github.com/neutronpy/neutronpy/wiki/Roadmap>`_ in the wiki for indications of new upcoming features) and as such, still has many bugs, so use at your own risk; see Disclaimer. To report bugs or suggest features see Contributions.
