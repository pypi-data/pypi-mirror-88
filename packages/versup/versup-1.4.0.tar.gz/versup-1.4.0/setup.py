If you provide an increment, it will get the\nlast version number from either the latest git tag that has a valid version,\nor from the default version in the config file.\n\n# Configuration\n\nVersup has a default configuration which is shown below\n\n```\n{\n    "force": False,  # Force the command without prompting the user\n    "silent": False,  # Minimize the amount of logs\n    "files": {},  # A map of `relativeFilePath: [regex, replacement, regexFlags?] | [regex, replacement, regexFlags?][]`\n    "version": {\n        "enabled": True,  # Bump the version number\n        "initial": "0.0.0",  # Initial version\n        "increments": [\n            "major",\n            "minor",\n            "patch",\n            "prerelease",\n            "build",\n        ],  # List of available increments to pick from\n    },\n    "changelog": {\n        "enabled": True,  # Enable changelog auto-updates\n        "create": False,  # Create the changelog file if it doesn"t exist\n        "open": True,  # Open the changelog file after bumping\n        "file": "CHANGELOG.md",  # Name of the changelog file\n        "version": "### Version [version]",  # Template for the version line\n        "commit": "- [message]",  # Template for the commit line\n        "separator": "\\n",  # Template for the separator between versions sections\n    },\n    "commit": {\n        "enabled": True,  # Commit the changes automatically\n        "message": "Update version to [version]",  # Template for the commit message\n        "mainbranch": "master",  # name of the main development or release branch\n    },\n    "tag": {\n        "enabled": True,  # Tag the bump commit\n        "name": "v[version]",  # Template for the name of the tag in the tag message\n    },\n    "tokens": {\n        "date": {\n            "format": "%Y-%m-%d"  # Python datetime format to use when generating the `[date]` token\n        },\n        "version_date": {\n            "format": "%Y-%m-%d"  # Python datetime format to use when generating the `[version_date]` token\n        },\n    },\n    "scripts": {\n        "prebump": "",  # Script to execute before bumping the version\n        "postbump": "",  # Script to execute after bumping the version\n        "prechangelog": "",  # Script to execute before updating the changelog\n        "postchangelog": "",  # Script to execute after updating the changelog\n        "precommit": "",  # Script to execute before committing\n        "postcommit": "",  # Script to execute after committing\n        "pretag": "",  # Script to execute before tagging\n        "posttag": "",  # Script to execute after tagging\n    },\n}\n\n```\n\nIf you want to override any settings, you can do this by creating a `~/.config/versup.json`\nfile or a `.versup.json` in your local project. Versup will read its default settings,\nthen merge in the global config (`~/.config/versup.json`), and finally\nmerge in the project level config.\n\n# Template tags\n\nIn various places you can define what text to use for commit messages, or tags etc.\nThese support tag fields that are replaced with relevant information. Known fields are:\n\n- version: The new version\n- message: The new commit message\n- date: Today\'s date formatted according to `tokens/date/format` in the config\n- version_date: Today\'s date formatted according to `tokens/version_date/format` in the config\n- hash: The new commit hash, full length\n- hash4: The new commit hash, first four characters\n- hash7: The new commit hash, first seven characters\n- hash8: The new commit hash, first eight characters\n- author_name: The author name from the git config\n- author_email: The author email from the git config\n\n# Updating files\n\nversup can update versions in files. The way this works is by configuring a regex\nfor each file that you want to update. So for example:\n\n```\n"files": {\n    "README.rst": [\n      ["Version ([\\\\d\\\\.]+) ", "Version [version] "],\n      ["Version is ([\\\\d\\\\.]+)", "Version is [version]"]\n    ]\n  },\n```\n\nHere the file `README.rst` is updated by matching a regex `Version ([\\\\d\\\\.]+)`\nwhich will match any text like `Version 1.3` or `Version 1.3.7`. They are standard\nregular expressions. The text that is matched is then replaced with the next argument\n`Version [version]` where `[version]` is the new version. You can regex and replace on\nanything really.\n\nThe supported increments are those supported by [Python Semver](https://python-semver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#raising-parts-of-a-version)\n\n- major\n- minor\n- patch\n- prerelease\n- build\n\n# Scripts\n\nThere are a number of pre and post scripts that can be executed at various\nstages of the bump process. These are under the `scripts` section. They are\ncalled as-is and receive the new version number as the only argument. They\ncan be anything, shell scripts, python scripts, etc, but they must be\nexecutable in a regular shell, as they will be invoked as such.\n\nFull Read The Docs can be found at [https://versup.readthedocs.io](https://versup.readthedocs.io)\n',
