Please be aware that by making the downloaded comics publicly available without the permission of the author, you may be infringing upon various copyrights.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Dependencies\n\n* Python (3.6 or newer)\n* click\n* scrapy (Some additional steps might be required to include this package and can be found [here](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html#intro-install-platform-notes))\n* scrapy-splash\n* scrapy-fake-useragent\n* tqdm\n\n### Process\n\n#### End user\n\n1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n2. Install the command line interface tool with `pip install webcomix`\n\n#### Developer\n\n1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n2. Clone this repository and open a terminal in its directory\n3. Install [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) with `pip install poetry`\n3. Download the dependencies by running `poetry install`\n4. Install pre-commit hooks with `pre-commit install`\n\n## Usage\n\n`webcomix [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]`\n\n### Global Flags\n\n#### help\n\nShow the help message and exit.\n\n#### Version\n\nShow the version number and exit.\n\n### Commands\n\n#### comics\n\nShows all predefined comics which can be used with the `download` command.\n\n#### download\n\nDownloads a predefined comic. Supports the `--cbz` flag, which creates a .cbz archive of the downloaded comic.\n\n#### search\n\nSearches for an XPath that can download the whole comic. Supports the `--cbz` flag, which creates a .cbz archive of the downloaded comic,`-s`, which verifies only the provided page of the comic, and `-y`, which skips the verification prompt.\n\n#### custom\n\nDownloads a user-defined comic. To download a specific comic, you\'ll need a link to the first page, an XPath expression giving out the link to the next page and an XPath expression giving out the link to the image. More info [here](http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp). Supports the `--cbz` flag, which creates a .cbz archive of the downloaded comic, `-s`, which verifies only the provided page of the comic, and `-y`, which skips the verification prompt.\n\n### Examples\n\n* `webcomix download xkcd`\n* `webcomix search xkcd --start-url=http://xkcd.com/1/`\n* `webcomix custom --cbz` (You will be prompted about other needed arguments)\n* `webcomix custom xkcd --start-url=http://xkcd.com/1/ --next-page-xpath="//a[@rel=\'next\']/@href" --image-xpath="//div[@id=\'comic\']//img/@src" --cbz` (Same as before, but with all arguments declared beforehand)\n\n### Making an XPath selector\n\nUsing an HTML inspector, spot a html path to the next link\'s `href` attribute/comic image\'s `src` attribute.\n\ne.g.: `//div[@class=\'foo\']/img/@src`\nThis will select the src attribute of the first image whose class is: foo\n\nNote: `webcomix` works best on static websites, since `scrapy`(the framework we use to travel web pages) doesn\'t process Javascript.\n\nTo make sure your XPath is correct, you have to go into `scrapy shell`, which should be downloaded when you\'ve installed `webcomix`.\n\n```\nscrapy shell <website> --> Use the website\'s url to go to it.\n> response.body --> Will give you the html from the website.\n> response.xpath --> Test an xpath selection. If you get [], this means your XPath expression hasn\'t gotten anything from the webpage.\n```\n\n### Downloading comics on Javascript-heavy websites\n\nIf the webcomic\'s website uses javascript to render its images, you won\'t be able to download it using the default configuration. webcomix now has an optional flag `-j` on both the `custom` and `search` command to execute the javascript using [scrapy-splash](https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash). In order to use it, you\'ll need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and run the following command before trying to download the comic:\n\n```\ndocker run -p 8050:8050 scrapinghub/splash\n```\n\n## Contribution\n\nThe procedure depends on the type of contribution:\n\n* If you simply want to request the addition of a comic to the list of supported comics, make an issue with the label "Enhancement".\n* If you want to request the addition of a feature to the system or a bug fix, make an issue with the appropriate label.\n\n### Running the tests\n\nTo run the tests, you have to use the `pytest` command in the webcomix folder.\n',
