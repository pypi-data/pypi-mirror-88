Description: # zava
        
        Parallel coordinates with Grand Tour for exploratory data visualization of massive and high-dimensional data in Python. If you want a desktop application for use, try [VizApp](https://github.com/oneoffcoder/vizapp).

        # Requirements
        
        At a minimum, you will need the following packages. 
        
        - python=3.8.3
        - numpy=1.19.2
        - scipy=1.5.2
        - pandas=0.25.3
        - matplotlib=3.3.2
        
        If you are generating animation videos, you will also need [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed, as that is what matplotlib uses by default to render videos. 
        
        ## Issues
        
        You may get into situations where ffmpeg appears to hang or stall. There are a lot of issues reported with matplotlib and ffmpeg interoperability.
