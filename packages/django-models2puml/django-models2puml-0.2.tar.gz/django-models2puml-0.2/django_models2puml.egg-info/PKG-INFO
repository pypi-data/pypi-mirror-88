        ## Installation & usage
        
        1. to use the application first you need to install it in your environment using pip:
        ```
        pip install django-models2puml
        ```
        
        2. Add the application to your settings INSTALLED_APPS:
        
        ```
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'models2puml',
            ]
        ```
        
        3. Use the newly available management command using manage.py
        
        ```
           ./manage.py generatepuml --apps <Installed app name(s)>
        ```
        
        4. The output of the command is a plantUML text description of a class diagram of your installed apps models
        
        ## ToDo
        
        - Add class relationships
        - Add the option to output the text to a file
        - Clean up the code
        - Add test coverage
        - Add the option to generate the diagram as an image (Not sure if this is appropriate here, will only add this option if convinced it's worth the added dependencies)
