Description: shotman
        =======
        
        A simple UI for handling screenshots.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        - ArchLinux: ``yay install shotman``.
        - Others: ``pip install shotman``.
        
        Setup
        -----
        
        You'll generally want to bind shotman to some hotkeys. I keep this in my sway
        settings::
        
            # Screenshots:
            # Super+P: Current window
            # Super+Shift+p: Select area
            # Super+Alt+p Current output
            # Super+Ctrl+p Select a window
        
            bindsym Mod4+p       exec shotman active
            bindsym Mod4+Shift+p exec shotman area
            bindsym Mod4+Mod1+p  exec shotman output
            bindsym Mod4+Ctrl+p  exec shotman window
        
        Note: the above supercedes the recommendation given by `grimshot`. Make sure you don't
        have both on your config file.
        
        I also recommend adding settings to position it on-screen. If you skip this, the window
        will show up centred, since Wayland clients cannot control their position::
        
            for_window [title="shotman"] move position 30 30
        
        It is currently not clear if this application should be exceptional and use a
        privileged API for better positioning or not.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ``shotman`` saves a screenshot to disk, and then shows a thumbnail and a simple
        interface.
        
        Actions
        ~~~~~~~
        
        You can execute the same actions with a mouse _or_ keyboard:
        
        - **Done**: Exits. The screenshot images remains on disk.
           
          - Primary Keybinding: ``Esc``.
          - Secundary Keybindings: ``Ctrl+q``, ``Ctrl+w``, ``q``, ``Ctrl+s``.
             
        - **Delete**: Deletes the image file and exists immediately.
        
          - Keybinding: ``d``.
          - Secundary Keybindings: ``Delete``, ``Ctrl+d``.
        
        - **Copy**: Copies the screenshot image to the clipboard. See caveats below.
        
          - Keybinding: ``Ctrl+C``.
        
        If there's a good, lightweight image editor that runs well on Wayland, I'd be happy to
        add an ``Edit`` button that opens the screenshot image in it.
        
        Caveats
        -------
        
        If you're not using a clipboard manager, any copied image will be lost after closing
        the window.
        
        There are plants to keep the application running in the background until it loses the
        clipboard handle to work around this.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        This tool relies on ``grimshot``. It's designed for sway, but should work on other
        wlroot compositors.
        
        Packaging
        ---------
        
        Dependencies for this package are Python3, PySide6 and grimshot. The ``wayland`` Qt
        plugin should also be installed (e.g.: ``qt6-wayland``).
