# biomappings ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/biomappings/biomappings)

Community curated and predicted equivalences and related mappings between named biological entities
that are not available from primary sources.

Human-curated mappings are in `src/biomappings/resources/mappings.tsv`, and
automatically predicated mappings are in `src/biomappings/resources/predictions.tsv`

Equivalences and related mappings that are available from the OBO Foundry and other
primary sources can be accessed through [Inspector Javert's Xref Database](https://zenodo.org/record/3757266)
on Zenodo which was described in [this blog post](https://cthoyt.com/2020/04/19/inspector-javerts-xref-database.html).
