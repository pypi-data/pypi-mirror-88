DNA Cauldron
===================

DNA Cauldron provides a generic cloning simulation framework to predict
constructs sequences and detect assembly flaws.
It can simulate Golden-Gate, with extra features like enzyme or
connector parts autoselection, and other methods like Gibson Assembly,
LCR Assembly, BASIC assembly, BioBrick assembly.
It supports single and combinatorial assemblies, hierarchical assemblies, and
produces nice reports for traceability and troubleshooting.
