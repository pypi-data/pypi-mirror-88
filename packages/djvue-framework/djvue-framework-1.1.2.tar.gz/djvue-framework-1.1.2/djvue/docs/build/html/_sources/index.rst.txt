Overview
========

.. note::

   This guide assumes intermediate knowledge of Django and DjangoRestFramework.
..

**DjVue** (*de íavy*) is a front/back-end application which allow a simple and fast data interaction through RESTful API
and standard HTTP communication using modern frameworks with an user friendly interface.
DjVue will automatically build the tables reflecting the database using bootstrap design.
DjVue also saves you the repetitive code writing for standard operations on the database such creations, updates and
deletions and leave you the concern of writing just the serializers.
