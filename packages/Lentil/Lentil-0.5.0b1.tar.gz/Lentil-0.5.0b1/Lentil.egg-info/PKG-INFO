        Lentil is a Python library for modeling the imaging chain of an optical system.
        It was originally developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab by the Wavefront Sensing and
        Control group (383E) to provide an easy to use framework for simulating point spread
        functions of segmented aperture telescopes.
        
        Lentil provides classes for representing optical elements with a simple interface for
        including effects like wavefront error, radiometric properties, and various noise and
        aberration sources. Lentil also provides numerical methods for performing Fraunhofer
        (far-field) diffraction calculations. The collection of classes provided by Lentil can
        be used to simulate imagery for a wide variety of optical systems.
        
        Lentil is still under active development and new features continue to be added. Until
        Lentil reaches version 1.0, the API is not guaranteed to be stable, but changes breaking
        backwards compatibility will be noted.
