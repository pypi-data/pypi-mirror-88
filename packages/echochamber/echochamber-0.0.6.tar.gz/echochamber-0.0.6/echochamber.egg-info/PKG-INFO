Description: # echochamber
        
        
        This tiny project is an example of creating a time series crawler at www.microprediction.org  Using some code adapted
        from pyESN written originally by Clemens Korndofer we create a "Crawler" which looks for univariate time 
        series and supplies predictions for them.  
        
        
        ## Install
        
           pip install echochamber
           pip install microprediction 
        
        ## Usage
        
        See /examples
        
            from microprediction import new_key
            from echochamber import EchoCrawler
            
            # Create and launch crawler
            
            if __name__=="__main__":
                write_key = new_key(difficulty=10)    # Patience is a virtue
                print(write_key)
                crawler = EchoCrawler(n_reservoir=50)
                crawler.run()
        
        To check its position on the leaderboards just plug in the write_key at https://www.microprediction.com/dashboard.html
        
        
        ## Write_key
        
        Generating may take half an hour or so. See www.muid.org for more information. We suggest you alter the code to hardwire your write_key.
