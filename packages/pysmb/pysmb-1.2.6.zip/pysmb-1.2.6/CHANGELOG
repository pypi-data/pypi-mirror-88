  If the remote server does not support SMB2, pysmb will fall back automatically
  to using SMB1 protocol.


pysmb-1.0.5, 7 May 2012
=======================

- Add supports for SMB message signing. pysmb will sign all SMB messages from
  the CIFS client to the server, but it does not verify the signatures of the
  SMB messages from the server.

=======================

- Adds support for "smb://" URL in urllib2 python packages to retrieve or upload
  files from/to remote CIFS servers.

  not properly converted to Epoch time.

  methods for a finer control of file retrieval operation with read offset and write
  limits.


pysmb-1.0.2, 31 March 2012
==========================

- Fix a bug in SMB._handleSessionChallenge() method in base.py where the domain attribute
  was not used to generate the corresponding NTLM authentication packets, resulting in
  the default WORKGROUP domain for used for all subsequent authentications.

========================

- Fixes a bug in listPath() method which causes directory listing for
  sub-directories to return an empty list.
- Fixes an incorrect implementation of the TRANS2_FIND_FIRST2 and
  TRANS2_FIND_NEXT2 request/response handling which causes directory listing
  to crash when the remote directory contains a certain number of entries.

pysmb-0.4.5, 22 Jun 2009
========================

- Prevents pysmb from failing when there are too many files/folders to
  be returned in a single SMB TRANS2 call. pysmb will "resume" requesting
  for more files/folders information in subsequent SMB TRANS2 requests.

pysmb-0.4.4, 12 Jan 2004
========================

- Add in support for AMK's Python Cryptography Toolkit which will be used

  epoch time rather than SMB time.
- Remove debugging printout in smb.py which has been released accidentally
  with the last release.
- Fix a bug in smbcp which causes to local to remote copy to fail

pysmb-0.4.1, 22 Jun 2002
========================

- Fix a bug in smb.py which does not return the correct file size for files
