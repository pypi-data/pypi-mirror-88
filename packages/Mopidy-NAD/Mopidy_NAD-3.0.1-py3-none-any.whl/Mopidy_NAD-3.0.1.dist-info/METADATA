`Mopidy <https://mopidy.com/>`_ extension for controlling volume using an
external NAD amplifier. Developed and tested with a NAD C355BEE.


Maintainer wanted
=================

Mopidy-NAD is currently kept on life support by the Mopidy core developers.
It is in need of a more dedicated maintainer.

If you want to be the maintainer of Mopidy-NAD, please:

1. Make 2-3 good pull requests improving any part of the project.

2. Read and get familiar with all of the project's open issues.

3. Send a pull request removing this section and adding yourself as the
   "Current maintainer" in the "Credits" section below. In the pull request
   description, please refer to the previous pull requests and state that
   you've familiarized yourself with the open issues.

As a maintainer, you'll be given push access to the repo and the authority to
make releases to PyPI when you see fit.


Installation
============

Install by running::

    sudo python3 -m pip install Mopidy-NAD

See https://mopidy.com/ext/nad/ for alternative installation methods.


Configuration
=============

The Mopidy-NAD extension is enabled by default. To disable it, add the
following to ``mopidy.conf``::

    [nad]
    enabled = false

The NAD amplifier must be connected to the machine running Mopidy using a
serial cable.

To use the NAD amplifier ot control volume, set the ``audio/mixer`` config
value in ``mopidy.conf`` to ``nad``. You probably also needs to add some
properties to the ``nad`` config section.

Supported properties includes:

- ``port``: The serial device to use, defaults to ``/dev/ttyUSB0``. This must
  be set correctly for the mixer to work.

- ``source``: The source that should be selected on the amplifier, like
  ``aux``, ``disc``, ``tape``, ``tuner``, etc. Leave unset if you don't want
  the mixer to change it for you.

- ``speakers-a``: Set to ``on`` or ``off`` (or ``true`` or ``false``) if you
  want the mixer to make sure that speaker set A is turned on or off. Leave
  unset if you don't want the mixer to change it for you.

- ``speakers-b``: See ``speakers-a``.

Configuration example with minimum configuration, if the amplifier is available
at ``/dev/ttyUSB0``::

    [audio]
    mixer = nad

Configuration example with minimum configuration, if the amplifier is available
elsewhere::

    [audio]
    mixer = nad

    [nad]
    port = /dev/ttyUSB3

Configuration example with full configuration::

    [audio]
    mixer = nad

    [nad]
    port = /dev/ttyUSB0
    source = aux
    speakers-a = true
    speakers-b = false
