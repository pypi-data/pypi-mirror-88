Description: # SimpleCsv
        
        This package is built to make it truly simple to open an work with a standard CSV file. It was initially written so that students who have just learned python can get started with data as early as possible. 
        
        ```python
        from simplecsv import SimpleCsv
        
        def main():
            data = SimpleCsv('test.csv')
            for datum in data:
                print(datum)
        ```
