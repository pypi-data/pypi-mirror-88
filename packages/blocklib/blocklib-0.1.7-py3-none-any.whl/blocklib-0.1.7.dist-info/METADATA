# Blocklib


Python implementations of record linkage blocking techniques. Blocking is a technique that makes
record linkage scalable. It is achieved by partitioning datasets into groups, called blocks and only
comparing records in corresponding blocks. This can reduce the number of comparisons that need to be
conducted to find which pairs of records should be linked.

`blocklib` is part of the **Anonlink** project for privacy preserving record linkage.
