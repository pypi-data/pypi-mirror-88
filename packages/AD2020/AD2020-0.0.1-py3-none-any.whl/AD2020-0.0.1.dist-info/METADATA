AD2020 is a Python package for automatic differentiation (AD). Differentiation is one of the key components in numerical computing and is ubiquitous in machine learning, optimization, and numerical methods. By repeatedly applying chain rule to elementary arithmetic operations and functions, AD is powerful to efficiently compute derivatives for complicated functions to machine precision.
