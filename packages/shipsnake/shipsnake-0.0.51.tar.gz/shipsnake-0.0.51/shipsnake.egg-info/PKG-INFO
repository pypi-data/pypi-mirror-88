Description: # ShipSnake
        A quick and easy way to distribute your python projects!
        
        Shipsnake will let you go from hello world to a published app in about 5 minutes!
        It generates a setup.py and correct directory structure for you in seconds, all with a simple config file.
        
        In addition to this, it can build your Mac and Windows apps in the cloud using GitHub actions, so you don't need to have both a Mac and Windows computer to create apps. To use this feature, activate it with the wizard. 
        
        Please see the [quickstart](#quickstart) for an example.
        ## Installation
        **Install with Pip:** `pip3 install shipsnake`
        ## Usage:
        > **Note:** Please use these commands in your base project directory, or they will fail.
        
        
        It is suggested that you run `shipsnake wizard` to get started.
        ### `shipsnake wizard`
        This command runs a setup wizard that generates a `shipsnake.toml` file in your current directory.
        It will also help you set up GitHub actions and creat a git repo.
        ### `shipsnake dev`
        This command lets you test your project on your onw system without needing to install it every time.
        ### `shipsnake [--options] build <version>`
        This command is where everything happens! There are several things that `build` does with the given version:
        1. First, it will build a directory structure that looks something like this.
        ```
        .
        ├── .github
        │   └── workflows
        │       └── shipsnake.yml
        ├── bin
        │   └── <compiled .sh files for your project>

        │   └── <compiled files ready for distribution>
        ├── <project name>
        │   ├── # This is where your source code goes:

        │   ├── mod2.py

        ├── README.md

        └── shipsnake.toml
        ```
        2. Generate GitHub Actions workflow files
        3. Generate `.app`, `.dmg`, `.exe`, `.msi` files *(depending on your configuration and system)*
        4. Generate files used for PyPi distribution.
        #### Options:
        Some valid commandline options are:
        `-y`: No interaction, always accept changes.
        `--actions-only`: Only generate actions file.
        `--mac-only`: Only generate mac file.
        `--windows-only`: Only generate windows file.
        `--pypi-only`: Only generate pypi files.
        `--no-installer`: Overide installer config.
        *These options can be combined*
        ### `shipsnake release [pypi | github]`
        This will upload your built project to PyPi and GitHub. *(or just one of them, depending on the command options)*
        ## Quickstart
        Let's say that we have a file `helloworld.py`:
        ```python3
        name = input("What's your name? ")
        print(f"Hello {name}!")
        ```
        That's all fine and good, but how will we distribute our awesome app so that all ou relatives and friends can run it?
        
        Whenever you have this problem, there are normally two solutions:
         - Get everyone to install Python, and then distribute copies of your source code.
        
        
         - Go through the trouble of packaging and distributing your project as a native application.
        
        
        Both of these are less than ideal, but with `shipsnake` there is a third option:
        	
         - Use shipsnake to distribute your project to PyPi, and also generate native applications and installers in about 5 minutes!
          
            - To do this we will need to install `shipsnake`: `pip3 install shipsnake`
        
            - Next, we will have to generate a `shipsnake.toml` file by running `shipsnake wizard`.
          
            - After we have done this, just type `shipsnake build 0.0.1` and wait for the build process to finish.
        
            - Next, we have to get a PyPi account. Go to [https://pypi.org/account/register/](https://pypi.org/account/register/) to register.
        
            - After that, just type in `shipsnake release` to finish!
            
            - Now, you can install your app by typing `pip3 install <your-app-name>` and run it with `<your-app-name>` if you have Python, or by launching the packaged app in the `./dist/pyinstaller/` folder.
