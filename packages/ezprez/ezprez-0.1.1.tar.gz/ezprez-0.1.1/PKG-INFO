        ## What does ezprez do?
        
        Let's you write simple python scripts to generate web presentations/slideshows
        
        ## Features & Roadmap
        
        ### Simple class based api
        
        The api iteself uses native python classes to create presentations in a short script that's easily editable
        
        ### No web experience needed
        
        Since this is a pure python API you can write web presentations without knowing HTML
        
        ### Backed on a reliable web framework
        
        Webslides powers this project and is a well-tested and stable web framework.
        
        ## Why should I use ezprez?
        
        Ezprez is the simplest API for writing web presentations without needing explicit knowledge of web development. If you are looking to create powerpoint style presentations [python-pptx](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [the google slides api](https://developers.google.com/slides/quickstart/python) is better suited for this job.
        
        ## Who is ezprez for?
        
        - People who want an easy way to create web presentations without editing html
        - People who know python but not web development technologies
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### From PyPi
        
        1. Run ```pip install ezprez```
        
        ### From source
        
        1. Clone this repo: (put github/source code link here)
        2. Run ```pip install .``` or ```sudo pip3 install .```in the root directory
        
        ## Quick-start
        
        For just plain text slides the easiest way to get started is just using the ```Slide``` and ```Presentation``` objects:
        
        ```python
        from ezprez.core import Slide, Presentation
        
        # Create a slide object (don't need to assign it to a variable or anything it's added to presentation on instantiation)
        Slide("This is the slide title", "this is some content")
        
        # Setup the actual presentation settings
        presentation_url = "https://kieranwood.ca/ezprez-example" # The URL the presentation will be hosted at
        prez = Presentation("This is the presentation title", "This is the presentation description", presentation_url)
        
        # Export the presentation in the current directory at /Presentation
        prez.export(".", folder_name="Presentation")
        ```
        
        There will then be a folder called Presentation, and inside the ```index.html``` file will contain your presentation. Just put that up on a static hosting service and you're good to go.
