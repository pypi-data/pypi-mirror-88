        ## About
        
        This library is a very basic tool to submit tickets to an Autotask help desk.
        
        ---
        
        ## Usage
        
        Initialize the `Client` class, providing the following parameters:
        
        - Autotask Base URL (e.g. <https://webservices15.autotask.net/atservicesrest/v1.0>)
        - Autotask API Integration Code
        - Autotask API User
        - Autotask API Secret
        
        Here is an example implementation:
        
        ```python
        from atrest import Client
        
        def submit_ticket():
            atclient = Client(
                "https://webservices15.autotask.net/atservicesrest/v1.0",
                "<api_integration_code>,
                "<api_user>",
                "<api_secret>"
            )
        
            ticket_title = "Major Issue!"
            ticket_desc = """
            There was a major issue.
        
            You should definitely check it out!
            """
        
            try:
                ticket_id = atclient.create_ticket(
                    ticket_title,
                    ticket_desc,
                    status=1,
                    priority=1,
                    company_id=0,
                    queue_id=29682833
                )
                print(f"Ticket successfully sent. Ticket ID: {ticket_id}")
            except Exception as e:
                raise e
        ```
