   Abstract:
   Authors: Warren Hack, Nadezhda Dencheva, Andy Fruchter, Perry Greenfield
   Date: 31 Oct 2012

   A convention for storing distortion information in HST images was developed
   and implemented in two software packages - PyWCS and STWCS. These changes
   allow the development of a WCS based version of Multidrizzle, released
   now as AstroDrizzle, and image alignment software, released as tweakreg.
   The distribution of WCS solutions is discussed.
