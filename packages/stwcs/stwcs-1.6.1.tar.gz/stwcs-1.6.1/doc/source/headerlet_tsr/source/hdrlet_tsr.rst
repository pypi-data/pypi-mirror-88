Introduction
============

The original motivation for this work was a WCS based replacement
of Multidrizzle, now released as Astrodrizzle, and specifically a
requirement for the availability and management of multiple WCS
sets, complete with distortion, within one science file. However,
the concept of encapsulating astrometric solutions is more general
than that since each solution may represent a different astrometric
alignment, either with a catalog or another image. Furthermore, computing
accurate astrometric solutions requires considerable effort and time so
having a way to distribute them, apply them to a science observation and
switch between different WCSs efficiently would facilitate many aspects of
data analysis.

Some of the immediate areas for the use of headerlets with HST data include
the HST archive, the HLA and other legacy projects which provide improved astrometry
of HST observations. The HST Archive, for example, provides access to all HST data,
most of which can not be readily combined together due to errors in guide star astrometry
imposing offsets between images taken using different pairs of guide stars.
A lot of effort has gone into computing those offsets so that all the images taken
at a particular pointing can be combined successfully with astrometry matched to
external astrometric catalogs. Unfortunately, there is no current mechanism for
passing those updated solutions along to the community without providing entirely
new copies of all the data.

Source Image
============

Any science observation with a valid WCS described by the FITS standard or any of the
WCS conventions implemented in pywcs may serve as a source for creating a headerlet.

We describe as an example the type of WCS information of a typical HST ACS/WFC image as it
is distributed by the HST archive (OTFR) after being processed with the latest image
calibrations, including applying the latest available distortion
models. The full description of the WCS is available in the
"Distortion Correction In HST Files" report [Hack]_ by Hack et al.
The science header now contains the following set of keywords and extensions to fully
describe the WCS with distortion:

* **Linear WCS keywords**: CRPIX, CRVAL, CTYPE, CD matrix keywords
* **SIP coefficients**: A_*_* and B_*_*, A_ORDER, B_ORDER
* **The first order coefficients from the IDC table**: (needed by astrodrizzle) OCX10, OCX11, OCY10, and OCY11 keywords
* **NPOL distortion**: if an NPOLFILE has been specified for the image,
    CPDIS and DP record-value keywords to point to WCSDVARR extensions (Distortion
    Paper [Calabretta]_ )
* **Detector defect correction**: (for ACS/WFC this is a column defect)if a D2IMFILE has been
    specified for use with the image, the D2IMEXT, D2IMERR and AXISCORR keywords point to the D2IMARR extension

Some of the distortion information may be stored in additional extensions in the science file:

* **WCSDVARR extensions**: 2 extensions for each chip with lookup tables containing
    the non-polynomial corrections, with each extension corresponding to an axis of
    the image (X correction or Y correction)
* **D2IMARR extension**: an extension with a lookup table containing the row- or column-correction from the D2IMFILE.

Each science header will have its own set of these keywords and extensions that will
be kept together as part of the headerlet definition.  This avoids any ambiguity as
to what solution was used for any given WCS.

An HST ACS/WFC exposure would end up with the following set of extensions::

    EXT#  FITSNAME      FILENAME              EXTVE DIMENS       BITPI OBJECT

    0     j8hw27c4q_flt j8hw27c4q_flt.fits                       16
    1       IMAGE       SCI                   1     4096x2048    -32
    2       IMAGE       ERR                   1     4096x2048    -32
    3       IMAGE       DQ                    1     4096x2048    16
    4       IMAGE       SCI                   2     4096x2048    -32
    5       IMAGE       ERR                   2     4096x2048    -32
    6       IMAGE       DQ                    2     4096x2048    16
    7       IMAGE       D2IMARR               1     4096         -32
    8       IMAGE       WCSDVARR              1     65x33        -32
    9       IMAGE       WCSDVARR              2     65x33        -32
    10      IMAGE       WCSDVARR              3     65x33        -32
    11      IMAGE       WCSDVARR              4     65x33        -32

These additional extensions add approximately 100kB to a typical ACS/WFC image
making them a space efficient means of managing all the distortion and WCS information.

Headerlet Definition
====================
A `headerlet` is a self-consistent definition of a single WCS
including all distortion for all chips/detectors of a single exposure.
This is different from alternate WCS defined in Greisen, E. W., and Calabretta (Paper I) [Greisen]_
in that by definition all alternate WCSs share the same distortion model while headerlets
may be based on different distortion models. A headerlet does not include alternate WCSs.
It is stored as a multi-extension FITS file following the structure of the science file.
The WCS information in the science header is saved in the header of an HDU with EXTNAME 'SIPWCS'.
All other HDUs in the headerlet (containing distorion information)
have the same EXTNAME as the science file.

SIPWCS - A New FITS Extension
-----------------------------

We introduce a new HDU with EXTNAME `SIPWCS`. It has no data and the header
contains all the WCS-related keywords from the SCI
header. As a minimum it contains the basic WCS keywords described in Paper I [Greisen]_
If the science observation has a SIP distortion model, the SIP keywords are included
in this extension. If the distortion includes a non-polynomial
part, the keywords describing the extensions with the lookup tables
(EXTNAME=WCSDVARR) are also in this header. If there's a detector defect correction
(row or column correction), the keywords describing the D2IMARR HDU are also in this
header. In addition, each SIPWCS header contains two keywords which point back to the HDU
of the original science file which was the source for it. These keywords are TG_ENAME and
TG_EVER and have the meaning of (extname, extver) for the data extension in the science file.

The keywords in this extension are used by the software to overwrite the keywords
in the corresponding SCI header to update the WCS solution for each chip without any
computation.

Headerlet File Structure
------------------------

This SIPWCS extension along with all WCSDVARR extensions and the D2IMARR extension if available
fully describe the WCS of each chip.
The listing of the FITS extensions for a `headerlet` for a sample ACS/WFC exposure after writing
it out to a file is::

    EXT#  FITSNAME      FILENAME              EXTVE DIMENS       BITPI OBJECT

    0     j8hw27c4q     j8hw27c4q_hdr.fits                       16
    1       IMAGE       SIPWCS                1                  8
    2       IMAGE       SIPWCS                2                  8
    3       IMAGE       WCSDVARR              1     65x33        -32
    4       IMAGE       WCSDVARR              2     65x33        -32
    5       IMAGE       WCSDVARR              3     65x33        -32
    6       IMAGE       WCSDVARR              4     65x33        -32
    7       IMAGE       D2IMARR               1     4096         -32


.. note::

   A headerlet derived from a full-frame WFC3/UVIS image would only
   contain a PRIMARY header and two SIPWCS  extensions (one for each SCI extension)
   as WFC3/UVIS does not currently have non-polynomial distortion or any detector defect corrections.

The keywords used to populate the headerlet come from all the extensions of the updated
FITS file, as illustrated in the following figure.

.. figure:: images/Headerlet_figure_final.png
   :width: 95 %
   :alt: Relationship Between an ACS/WFC Imageâ€™s FITS File and a Headerlet
   :align: center

   This figure shows the keywords that are included in a headerlet, the extensions included
   in a headerlet, and how a headerlet appears as a new extension when it gets appended to the
   original ACS/WFC file.


Headerlet Primary Header
-------------------------

The list below contains all keywords specific to the primary header of a headerlet with
a brief description how to determine their value. Note that all keywords will be present in the header
and 'required' and 'optional' below refers to their value.

 * `HDRNAME`  - (required) a unique name for the headerlet
                 - the value is given by the user as a parameter to `~stwcs.wcsutil.headerlet.create_headerlet` or `~stwcs.wcsutil.headerlet.write_headerlet`
                 - HDRNAME<wcskey> from the science file is used
                 - WCSNAME<wcskey> from the science file is used
                 - KeyError is raised
 * `DESTIM`   - (required) target image filename - used to determine if a headerlet can be applied to a science file.
                - the ROOTNAME keyword of the original science file
                - the name of the science file
 * `WCSNAME`  - (required) name for the WCS
                - the value is given by the user as a parameter to `~stwcs.wcsutil.headerlet.create_headerlet` or `~stwcs.wcsutil.headerlet.write_headerlet`
                - WCSNAME<wcskey> from the science file is used
                - the value of hdrname parameter is used
                - HDRNAME<wcskey> from the science file
                - KeyError is raised
 * `DISTNAME` - (optional) name of distortion model
                - The value of DISTNAME has the form
                    <idctab rootname>-<npolfile rootname>-<d2imfile rootname>
                    and has a value of 'NONE' if no reference files are specified.
 * `SIPNAME`  - (optional) name of SIP model
                - SIPNAME is constructed as <ROOTNAME>_<IDCTAB_rootname>, where

                  ROOTNAME is the keyword from the science file header (or the file name)

                  IDCTAB_rootname is the rootname of the idctab file

                  so for example, SIPNAME for a science file j94f05bgq_flt.fits and an idctab file
                  postsm4_idc.fits is j94f05bgq_postsm4

                - If the SIP coefficients are present in the header but IDCTAB is missing or invalid, then SIPNAME is set to UNKNOWN.
                - If there's no polynomial model, SIPNAME is set to NOMODEL.
 * `NPOLFILE` - (optional) name of npol reference file

                - NPOLFILE keyword from science file primary header

                - UNKNOWN if NPOLFILE keyword is missing or invalid but data extensions exist

                - or  NOMODEL

 * `IDCTAB`   - (optional)

                IDCTAB keyword from science file primary header or N/A

 * `D2IMFILE` - (optional)

                D2IMFILE keyword from science file primary header or N/A

 * `AUTHOR`   - (optional) name of person who created the headerlet
 * `DESCRIP`  - (optional) short description of the headerlet solution
 * `NMATCH`   - (optional) number of sources used in the new solution fit, if updated from the Archiveâ€™s default WCS
 * `CATALOG`  - (optional) a reference frame used to define the astrometric solution
 * `UPWCSVER` - (optional) version of STWCS used to create the WCS of the original image
 * `PYWCSVER` - (optional) version of PyWCS used to create the WCS of the original image


These keywords are used to determine whether a headerlet can be applied to a
given exposure or not. Some of the keywords provide more
information about the solution itself, how it was derived, and by whom.

Working With Headerlets
=======================

Headerlets are implemented in a python module `~stwcs.wcsutil.headerlet` which uses PyWCS for
WCS management and PyFITS for FITS file handling. The functionality includes methods to:


    - Create a headerlet (on disk or in memory) from a specific WCS of a science observation.
       This can be the Primary or an alternate WCS.
    - Apply a WCS from a headerlet to the Primary WCS of a science observation (and
       optionally save the original WCS as an alternate WCs or a different headerlet).
    - Copy a WCS from a headerlet as an alternate WCS.
    - Attach a headerlet to a science file.
    - Archive a WCS of a science file as a headerlet attached to the file.
    - Delete a headerlet attached to a science file.
    - Print a summary of all headerlets attached to a science file.

An optional GUI interface is available through TEAL and includes functions for writing a headerlet,
applying a headerlet, etc. A full listing of all functions with GUI interface is available
after `stwcs.wcsutil` is imported.

The headerlet API as of the time of writing this report is documented in :ref:`Appendix1`.

`Note: For an up-to-date API always consult the current the SSB documentation pages.`

Headerlet HDU - A New Type of FITS Extension
--------------------------------------------

The word `headerlet` has been used sofar in three different ways:

- A single WCS representation
- The multi-extension FITS file storing a WCS
- The extension of a science file containing a headerlet (as a WCS representation)

The last usage of the term `headerlet` is discussed in this section.
When a `headerlet` is applied to an image, a copy of the original headerlet file is
appended to the image's HDU list as a special extension HDU called a `HeaderletHDU`.
A HeaderletHDU consists of a simple header describing the headerlet, and has as its data
the headerlet file itself, (which may be compressed). A HeaderletHDU has an 'XTENSION'
value of 'HDRLET'. Support for this is provided through the implementation of a
NonstandardExtHDU in PyFITS.

When opening a file that contains `Headerlet HDU` extensions, it will normally look like this in PyFITS::

    >>> import pyfits
    >>> hdul = pyfits.open('94f05bgq_flt_with_hlet.fits')
    >>> hdul.info()
    Filename: j94f05bgq_flt_with_hlet.fits
    No.    Name         Type      Cards   Dimensions   Format

    8    WCSDVARR    ImageHDU        15  (65, 33)      float32
    9    WCSDVARR    ImageHDU        15  (65, 33)      float32
    10   WCSDVARR    ImageHDU        15  (65, 33)      float32

    13   HDRLET  NonstandardExtHDU   13
    14   HDRLET  NonstandardExtHDU   13



The names of the `headerlet` extensions are both HDRLET, but its type shows up
as `NonstandardExtHDU`. Their headers can be read, and while their data can be
read you'd have to know what to do with it (the data is actually
either a tar file or a gzipped tar file containing the
`headerlet` file).  However, if you have `stwcs.wcsutil.headerlet` imported, PyFITS will
recognize these extensions as `Headerlet HDUs`::


    >>> import stwcs.wcsutil.headerlet
    >>> # Note that it's necessary to reopen the file
    >>> hdul = pyfits.open('j94f05bgq_flt_with_hlet.fits')
    >>> hdul.info()

``HeaderletHDU`` objects are similar to other HDU objects in PyFITS.
However, they have a special ``.headerlet`` attribute that returns
the actual `headerlet` contained in the HDU data as a `Headerlet` object::

    >>> hdrlet = hdul['HDERLET', 1].headerlet
    >>> hdrlet.info()
    Filename: (No file associated with this HDUList)
    No.    Name         Type      Cards   Dimensions   Format

    3    WCSDVARR    ImageHDU        15  (65, 33)      float32

    6    WCSDVARR    ImageHDU        15  (65, 33)      float32
    7    D2IMARR     ImageHDU        12  (4096,)       float32

This is useful if you want to view the contents of the `headerlets` attached to a file.

Examples
--------

To create a `headerlet` from an image, a `createHeaderlet()` function is provided::

    >>> from stwcs.wcsutil import headerlet
    >>> hdrlet = headerlet.createHeaderlet('j94f05bgq_flt.fits', 'VERSION1')
    >>> type(hdrlet)
    <class 'stwcs.wcsutil.headerlet.Headerlet'>
    >>> hdrlet.info()
    Filename: (No file associated with this HDUList)
    No.    Name         Type      Cards   Dimensions   Format
    0    PRIMARY     PrimaryHDU      12  ()
    1    SIPWCS      ImageHDU       111  ()
    2    SIPWCS      ImageHDU       110  ()
    3    WCSDVARR    ImageHDU        15  (65, 33)      float32
    4    WCSDVARR    ImageHDU        15  (65, 33)      float32
    5    WCSDVARR    ImageHDU        15  (65, 33)      float32
    6    WCSDVARR    ImageHDU        15  (65, 33)      float32
    7    D2IMARR     ImageHDU        12  (4096,)       float32

As you can see, the `Headerlet` object is similar to a normal PyFITS `HDUList` object.  `createHeaderlet()` can be given either the path
to a file, or an already open `HDUList` as its first argument.

What do you do with a `Headerlet` object?  Its main purpose is to apply its WCS solution to another file.  This can be done using the
`Headerlet.apply()` method::

    >>> hdrlet.apply('some_other_image.fits')

Or you can use the `applyHeaderlet()` convenience function.  It takes an existing `headerlet` file path or object as its first argument;
the rest of its arguments are the same as `Headerlet.apply()`.  As with `createHeaderlet()` both of these can take a file path or opened
`HDUList` objects as arguments.

When a `headerlet` is applied to an image, an additional `headerlet` containing that image's original WCS solution is automatically created,
and is appended to the file's HDU list as a `Headerlet HDU`.  However, this behavior can be disabled by setting the `createheaderlet` keyword
argument to `False` in either `Headerlet.apply()` or `applyHeaderlet()`.

        Save a WCS as a headerlet FITS file.

        This function will create a headerlet, write out the headerlet to a
        separate headerlet file, then, optionally, attach it as an extension
        to the science image (if it has not already been archived)

        Either wcsname or wcskey must be provided; if both are given, they must
        match a valid WCS.

        Updates wcscorr if necessary.

        Parameters
        ----------
        filename: string or HDUList or Python list
            This specifies the name(s) of science file(s) from which headerlets
            will be created and written out.
            String input formats supported include use of wild-cards, IRAF-style
            '@'-files (given as '@<filename>') and comma-separated list of names.
            An input filename (str) will be expanded as necessary to interpret
            any environmental variables included in the filename.
        hdrname: string
            Unique name for this headerlet, stored as HDRNAME keyword
        output: string or None
            Filename or just rootname of output headerlet FITS file
            If string does not contain '.fits', it will create a filename
            starting with the science filename and ending with '_hlet.fits'.
            If None, a default filename based on the input filename will be
            generated for the headerlet FITS filename
        sciext: string
            name (EXTNAME) of extension that contains WCS to be saved
        wcsname: string
            name of WCS to be archived, if " ": stop
        wcskey: one of A...Z or " " or "PRIMARY"
            if " " or "PRIMARY" - archive the primary WCS
        destim: string
            DESTIM keyword
            if  NOne, use ROOTNAME or science file name
        sipname: string or None (default)
             Name of unique file where the polynomial distortion coefficients were
             read from. If None, the behavior is:
             The code looks for a keyword 'SIPNAME' in the science header
             If not found, for HST it defaults to 'IDCTAB'
             If there is no SIP model the value is 'NOMODEL'
             If there is a SIP model but no SIPNAME, it is set to 'UNKNOWN'
        npolfile: string or None (default)
             Name of a unique file where the non-polynomial distortion was stored.
             If None:
             The code looks for 'NPOLFILE' in science header.
             If 'NPOLFILE' was not found and there is no npol model, it is set to 'NOMODEL'
             If npol model exists, it is set to 'UNKNOWN'
        d2imfile: string
             Name of a unique file where the detector to image correction was
             stored. If None:
             The code looks for 'D2IMFILE' in the science header.
             If 'D2IMFILE' is not found and there is no d2im correction,
             it is set to 'NOMODEL'
             If d2im correction exists, but 'D2IMFILE' is missing from science
             header, it is set to 'UNKNOWN'
        author: string
            Name of user who created the headerlet, added as 'AUTHOR' keyword
            to headerlet PRIMARY header
        descrip: string
            Short description of the solution provided by the headerlet
            This description will be added as the single 'DESCRIP' keyword
            to the headerlet PRIMARY header
        history: filename, string or list of strings
            Long (possibly multi-line) description of the solution provided
            by the headerlet. These comments will be added as 'HISTORY' cards
            to the headerlet PRIMARY header
            If filename is specified, it will format and attach all text from
            that file as the history.
        attach: bool
            Specify whether or not to attach this headerlet as a new extension
            It will verify that no other headerlet extension has been created with
            the same 'hdrname' value.
        clobber: bool
            If output file already exists, this parameter specifies whether or not
            to overwrite that file [Default: False]
        logging: boolean
             enable file logging
