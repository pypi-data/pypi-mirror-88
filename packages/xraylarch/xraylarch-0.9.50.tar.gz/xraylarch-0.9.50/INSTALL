Installation instructions for Larch
========================================

These instructions describe how to install Larch on any supported platforms:
Windows, MacOS, or Linux.

The easiest approach is to install Larch using the latest pre-packaged
installers from http://cars.uchicago.edu/xraylarch/downloads.

If you would like to install from the source code in this folder, you will
need Python 2.7, 3.5, or 3.6 and several required Python packages.  With those
packages installed, you should be able to install Larch with

   python setup.py install

If you are using the system-installed Python on Linux or MacOS, you will
probably need to install with super-user privileges, as with::

   sudo python setup.py install


Further details are given in doc/installation.rst

Customization
===============================

The location of the the system-wide and per-user larch directories can be
configured by editing the simple file lib/site_configdata.py.
Currently, this file looks like this::

   unix_installdir = '/usr/share/larch'
   unix_userdir    = '.larch'

   win_installdir = 'C:\\Program Files\\larch'
   win_userdir    = 'larch'

You can customize the installed locations by adjusting these values prior
to installation.
