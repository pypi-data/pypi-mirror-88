The files here generate a poster-sized Periodic Table of X-ray absorption
edges and emission lines using data from Elam, Ravel, and Sieber, Radiation
Physics and Chemistry 63 (2002).

The latex source file used is heavily derived from the periodic tables of
the elememts by Ivan Griffin in the tikZ example set
    http://texample.net/tikz/examples/periodic-table-of-chemical-elements/

Building the Xray Periodic Table
=================================

The PDF version of the periodic table can then be generated with
   make

This assumes a few things:
   a) latex and a reasonably modern version of the TikZ package are installed.
   b) XrayDB from the xraylarch package has been installed. XrayDB
      contains the daata from Elam, et al. used to generate the table.
      The gen_atoms.py script uses this to extract the data and write out
      latex paragraphs for each element into the file atoms.tex.

          python gen_atoms.py > atoms.tex

   c) edit the top of xray_table.tex to select image of scientist and poster size.
