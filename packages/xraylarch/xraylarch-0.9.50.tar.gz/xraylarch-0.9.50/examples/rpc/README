This directory shows examples of using larch by Remote Procedure Call. 
This has several important possible use cases:
 1. Larch can be run on a separate machine
 2. Multiple larch process can be running simultaneously, 
    and a client can switch between them.
 3. A client can exit, but the underlying larch process
    can be persistent, and so re-joined later.

To start a larch RPC server, you can use either
    larch -r
or
    larch_server -r start

You can specify a port with 
    larch -r -p 4966
or
    larch_server -p 4966 start

The larch_server program also takes commands of 
  stop     to stop a server
  restart  to stop and restart a server (on the same port)
  status   to tell whether a server is running
  report   to give a brief report about a running server
  next     to start a server on the next unused port 


The examples here shows a simple client that simply runs some larch
commands and retrieves some data (which is transferred with json).
