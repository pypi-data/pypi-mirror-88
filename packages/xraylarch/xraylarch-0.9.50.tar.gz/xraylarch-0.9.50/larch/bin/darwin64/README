These shared libraries and executables here were modified using
`install_name_tool` so that the local versions of the gfortran libs are
found and used.  The resulting libs and executables rely only on each other
and on /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib

Use `pathfix.py` to generate the install_name_tool commands used to make
this fix.
