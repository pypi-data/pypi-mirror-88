This is an active fork of [baiji][upstream], a high-level Python abstraction
layer for Amazon S3:

1. An [`open`][open]-like context handler which allows using S3 keys and
   local files interchangeably.
     - When reading S3, contents are first written to a temporary local
       file.
     - When writing S3, contents are written to a temporary local file,
       and uploaded on close.
2. An `s3` CLI for listing, copying, syncing, and other common activities.

The fork's goals are modest:

- Keep the library working in current versions of Python and other tools.
- Make bug fixes.
- Provide API stability and backward compatibility with the upstream version.
- Respond to community contributions.

It's used by related forks such as [lace][].

Features
--------

- Works without an S3 connection (with local files).
- Supports multiprocess parallelism for copying lots of files.
- Supports Python 2.7 and uses boto2.
- Supports OS X, Linux, and Windows.
- Tested and production-hardened.

Examples
--------

```py
with s3.open('s3://example/info.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('hello')

with s3.open('file:///home/me/info.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('hello')

with s3.open('s3://example/info.txt', 'r') as f:
    contents = f.readlines()

with s3.open('file:///home/me/info.txt', 'r') as f:
    contents = f.readlines()
```

```sh
s3 cp foo.txt s3://example/bar.txt
s3 cp s3://example/bar.txt s3://another-example/bazinga.txt
s3 rm s3://example/bar.txt
```


Development
-----------

```sh
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
rake test
rake lint
```


TODO
----

1. Migrate credentials to `~/.aws/credentials` or env, and deprecate AWS
   credential support in `~/.bodylabs`.
2. Move `baiji.util.parallel` into a separate library.
3. Upgrade to boto3.
