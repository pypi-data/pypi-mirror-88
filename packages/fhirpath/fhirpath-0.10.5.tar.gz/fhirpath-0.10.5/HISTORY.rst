0.10.5 (2020-12-17)
-------------------

Improvement

- ``BundleWrapper`` is providing two optional methods, ``calculate_fhir_base_url`` and ``resolve_absolute_uri`` and is now also taking optional parameter ``base_url``.


Fixes
- fixes ``ElasticSearchDialect.create_term`` [Kartik Sayani]

- fixes ``EngineResult.extract_references``. [Jason Paumier]

- fixes how composite search params are parsed. [Jason Paumier]

- Issue#28 `Nested GroupTerm search returns no matches <https://github.com/nazrulworld/fhirpath/issues/28>`_

- fixes ``SearchContext.normalize_param`` for composite search params [nazrulworld]

0.10.4 (2020-11-19)
-------------------

- fixes ``FHIRAbstractModel`` comparing at ``utils`` module for BundleWrapper.

- ``fallback_callable`` helper function is available at ``utils`` module.


0.10.3 (2020-11-17)
-------------------

Improvements

- More helper functions (``get_local_timezone``, ``timestamp_utc``, ``timestamp_utc``) are created.

- ``initial_bundle_data`` method is now available in Base Elasticsearch engine class,
  meaning that it is possible construct Bundle initial data into the derived class, so more flexibility.

Bugfixes

- Default bundle initial data was constructed ``meta.lastUpdated`` value with utc now time but without timezone offset, so
  during json serialization, timezone info was missed as a result reverse construct of Bundle complains validation error.

0.10.2 (2020-11-06)
-------------------

Improvements

- ``orjson`` is no longer required. ``json_dumps`` and ``json_loads`` now dynamically supports
  orjson and simplejson.


0.10.1 (2020-11-04)
-------------------

Bugfixes

- ``Connection.raw_connection`` was wrongly wrapped by ``AsyncElasticsearchConnection/ElasticsearchConnection.from_url()`` with self, instead of ``elasticsearch.AsyncElasticsearch/elasticsearch.Elasticsearch``'s instance.


0.10.0 (2020-11-04)
-------------------

Improvements


- Introducing `AsyncElasticsearchConnection`` and ``AsyncElasticsearchEngine`` the asyncio based connection and engine for Elasticsearch. See `Using Asyncio with Elasticsearch <https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/7.9.1/async.html>`_

- Added ``orjson`` based json serializer for Elasticsearch by default (when connection is made from connection factory).

- Added support for `_summary=text|data|count|true|false`. [arkhn]

- Added support for `_elements` search parameter. [arkhn]


Breaking

- ``async_result`` parameter is no longer needed for SearchContext, Search and Query (included async version) as from now all
  engine contains that information (``engine_class.is_async()``).

0.9.1 (2020-10-24)
------------------

- Added supports for ``_format`` and ``_pretty`` params, now there should no complain for those, instead of simply ignored. [nazrulworld]


0.9.0 (2020-10-24)
------------------

- Handle ``:identifier`` modifier for reference search parameters [simonvadee]

- fixes `BundleWrapper`` as_json mode, now includes with ``resourceType`` value. [nazrulworld]

- ``Dict`` response option has bee added in ``fhirpath.search.fhir_search`` [nazrulworld]

- Ignore empty search params #21 [simonvadee]

- Just for performance optimization issue minimum required ``zope.interface`` version is ``5.1.2``.

0.8.1 (2020-10-05)
------------------

- Disable pydantic validation for Bundle in fhirpath.utils.BundleWrapper [simonvadee]

- Two helper functions ``json_dumps`` and ``json_loads`` are now available under utils module [nazrulworld]

- Only apply search prefix on affected types #17 [simonvadee]

0.8.0 (2020-09-25)
------------------

Improvements

- add supports for some important FHIR search parameters (``_has``, ``_include`` and ``_revinclude``) [simonvadee]

- enable search on several resource types (_type search param) [Jasopaum]

- Issue #8 `Add search support for without any params or query string if context has resource type <https://github.com/nazrulworld/fhirpath/issues/8>`_ [nazrulworld]

- Issue #9 `multiple negative not working <https://github.com/nazrulworld/fhirpath/issues/9>`_ [nazrulworld]

Breaking

- ``fhirpath.search.SearchContext.resource_name`` has been changed ``fhirpath.search.SearchContext.resource_type`` and
  now datatype is List instead of string. Please check your API. [Jasopaum]

- For case of ``Elasticsearch`` based engine, you should use custom analyzer (``fhir_reference_analyzer``) for FHIR Reference type. For details see readme.


0.7.1 (2020-08-07)
------------------

- added missing ``isodate`` package dependency.


0.7.0 (2020-08-07)
