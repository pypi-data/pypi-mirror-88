        About The Spectral Library Tool
        ###############################
        
        The Spectral Library Tool software package is both a QGIS plugin and stand-alone python package that provides a suite of
        processing tools for multi- and hyperspectral spectral libraries.
        
        The software is based on VIPER Tools: code written for ENVI/IDL and released in 2007.
        Several updates have been released since and now it has been ported to PyQGIS in the period 2017 - 2020.
        The original VIPER Tools is now split over two python/QGIS tools: Spectral Library Tools and MESMA.
        
        **Spectral Library Tool** provides the following:
         - Creating spectral libraries interactively (selecting spectra from an image or using regions of interest) and managing
           the metadata (developed by HU Berlin)
         - Optimizing spectral libraries with Iterative Endmember Selection, Ear-Masa-Cob, CRES, MUSIC or AMUSES
         - Website: <https://spectral-libraries.readthedocs.io>
         - Repository: https://bitbucket.org/kul-reseco/spectral-libraries
        
        **MESMA** provides the following:
         - Running SMA and MESMA (with multi-level fusion, stable zone unmixing, ...)
         - Post-processing of the MESMA results (visualisation tool, shade normalisation, ...)
         - Website: <https://mesma.readthedocs.io>
         - Repository: https://bitbucket.org/kul-reseco/mesma
        
        The software has now been developed in the open source environment to encourage further development of the tool.
