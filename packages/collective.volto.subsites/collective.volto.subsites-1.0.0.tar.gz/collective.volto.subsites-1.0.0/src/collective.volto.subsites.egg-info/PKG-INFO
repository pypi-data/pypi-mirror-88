Description: 
        ==============
        Volto Subsites
        ==============
        
        This add-on enable a new **Subsite** content-type and provides some utilities for Volto.
        
        
        Subsite
        -------
        
        It's a basic folderish content with some additional fields:
        
        - Header text
        - Footer text
        - Color
        - Image
        
        These fields are useful for Volto theme that will draw some components based on these values.
        
        Accessing Subsite data from restapi
        ------------------------------------
        
        There is a new expansion slot in restapi response when getting content data: `subsite`.
        
        This expansion works like the standard ones (workflow, breadcrumbs, etc) and returns some metadata of the
        parent Subsite if the requested content is inside a Subsite.
        
        Control panel
        -------------
        
        There is a control panel that allows to set some settings for Subsites:
        
        - Styles: you can set a predefined list of css classes that will be used in Volto theme to set some custom styles inside the subsite.
