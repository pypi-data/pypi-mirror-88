    **Creating a User-Defined Recruitment Function**

    An optional argument has been created in the Fisheries Model to allow users
    proficient in Python to pass their own recruitment function into the
    program via the args dictionary.

    Using the Beverton-Holt recruitment function as an example, here's how a
    user might create and pass in their own recruitment function::

        import natcap.invest
        import numpy as np

        # define input data
        Matu = np.array([...])  # the Maturity vector in the Population
            Parameters File
        Weight = np.array([...])  # the Weight vector in the Population
            Parameters File
        LarvDisp = np.array([...])  # the LarvalDispersal vector in the
            Population Parameters File
        alpha = 2.0  # scalar value
        beta = 10.0  # scalar value
        sexsp = 2   # 1 = not sex-specific, 2 = sex-specific

        # create recruitment function
        def spawners(N_prev):
            return (N_prev * Matu * Weight).sum()

        def rec_func_BH(N_prev):
            N_0 = (LarvDisp * ((alpha * spawners(
                N_prev) / (beta + spawners(N_prev)))) / sexsp)
            return (N_0, spawners(N_prev))

        # fill out args dictionary

    Conditions that a new recruitment function must meet to run properly:

    + **The function must accept as an argument:** a single numpy three-
        dimensional array (N_prev) representing the state of the population at
        the previous time step. N_prev has three dimensions: the indices of the
        first dimension correspond to the region (must be in same order as
        provided in the Population Parameters File), the indices of the second
        dimension represent the sex if it is specific (i.e. two indices
        representing female, then male if the model is 'sex-specific', else
        just a single zero index representing the female and male populations
        aggregated together), and the indicies of the third dimension represent
        age/stage in ascending order.

    + **The function must return:** a tuple of two values. The first value
        (N_0) being a single numpy one-dimensional array representing the
        youngest age of the population for the next time step. The indices of
        the array correspond to the regions of the population (outputted in
        same order as provided). If the model is sex-specific, it is currently
        assumed that males and females are produced in equal number and that
        the returned array has been already been divided by 2 in the
        recruitment function. The second value (spawners) is the number or
        weight of the spawners created by the population from the previous time
        step, provided as a scalar float value (non-negative).

    Example of How Recruitment Function Operates within Fisheries Model::

        # input data
        N_prev_xsa = [[[region0-female-age0, region0-female-age1],
                       [region0-male-age0, region1-male-age1]],
                      [[region1-female-age0, region1-female-age1],
                       [region1-male-age0], [region1-male-age1]]]

        # execute function
        N_0_x, spawners = rec_func(N_prev_xsa)

        # output data - where N_0 contains information about the youngest
        #     age/stage of the population for the next time step:
        N_0_x = [region0-age0, region1-age0] # if sex-specific, rec_func should
            divide by two before returning type(spawners) is float
