# these are the minimum packages needed in order to execute the natcap.invest

# NOTE: GDAL is *not* required here because the compiled cython module
# will dynamically import GDAL via python's import system.  This behavior means
# that we can provide a much easier build experience so long as GDAL is
# available at runtime.
