        About  InVEST
        =============
        
        InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) is a family
        of tools for quantifying the values of natural capital in clear, credible, and
        practical ways. In promising a return (of societal benefits) on investments in
        nature, the scientific community needs to deliver knowledge and tools to
        quantify and forecast this return. InVEST enables decision-makers to quantify
        the importance of natural capital, to assess the tradeoffs associated with
        alternative choices, and to integrate conservation and human development.
        
        Older versions of InVEST ran as script tools in the ArcGIS ArcToolBox environment,
        but have almost all been ported over to a purely open-source python environment.
        
        InVEST is licensed under a permissive, modified BSD license.

        Installing InVEST
        =================
        
        Python Dependencies
        -------------------
        
        Dependencies for ``natcap.invest`` are listed in ``requirements.txt``:
        
        .. code-block::
        
            GDAL>=3.1.2
            Pyro4==4.77
            pandas>=1.0
            numpy>=1.11.0,!=1.16.0
            Rtree>=0.8.2,!=0.9.1
            Shapely>=1.7.1,<2.0.0
            scipy>=0.16.1,<1.5.0
            pygeoprocessing>=2.1.1
            taskgraph[niced_processes]>=0.10.2
            psutil>=5.6.6
            chardet>=3.0.4
            xlrd>=1.2.0
            xlwt
        
        Additionally, a python binding for Qt is needed to use the InVEST GUI, but is
        not required for development against ``natcap.invest``.  InVEST uses the
        interface library ``qtpy`` to support ``PyQt5`` and ``PySide2``.  In our 
        experience, ``PyQt5`` and ``PySide2`` have been easiest
        to work with.  One of these bindings for Qt must be installed in order to use
        the GUI.
        
        
        Installing from Source
        ----------------------
        
        If you have a compiler installed and configured for your system, and
        dependencies installed, the easiest way to install InVEST as a python package
        is:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip install natcap.invest
        
        
        Installing the latest development version
        -----------------------------------------
        
        The latest development version of InVEST can be installed from our git
        source tree:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip install git+https://github.com/natcap/invest@master#egg=natcap.invest
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        Dependencies for developing InVEST are listed in ``requirements.txt`` and in
        ``requirements-dev.txt``.  If you're running a GUI, you'll need a Qt binding
        (see above) and the packages installed in ``requirements-gui.txt``.
