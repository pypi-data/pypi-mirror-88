        =======
        
        This is a very thin Python wrapper Eric Biggers' excellent
        [libdeflate](https://github.com/ebiggers/libdeflate). Currently, it only handles compression and decompression of
        gzip data, with a very basic API:
        
        ```python
        import deflate
        level = 6  # The default; may be 1-12 for libdeflate.
        compressed = deflate.gzip_compress(b"hello world!" * 1000, level)
        original = deflate.gzip_decompress(compressed)
        ```
