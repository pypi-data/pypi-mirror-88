        ## User guide
        
        Working process are divided by short breaks on iterations. 
        
        One iteration is:
        - 25 min working
            - 5 min break
        - 25 min working
            - 5 min break
        - 25 min working
            - 5 min break
        - 25 min working
        - 20 min break
        
        After last (20 min) break new iteration will be started.
        
        To start timer you should click on the `Start` button.
        If the work is finished you can click `Reset` to reset timer state or just close the application.
        
        In the bottom you can see how many stages of the iteration were passed. One stage contains (`work` + `break`) time line.
