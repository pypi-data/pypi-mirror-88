Description: # libfmp
        
        This repository contains the Python package libfmp. This package goes hand in hand with the FMP Notebooks, a collection of educational material for teaching and learning Fundamentals of Music Processing (FMP) with a particular focus on the audio domain. For detailed explanations and example appliciations of the libfmp-functions we refer to the FMP Notebooks:
        
        http://audiolabs-erlangen.de/FMP
        
        In particular, there is a dedicated notebook for libfmp:

        ## Installing
        
        You can install libfmp using the Python package manager pip:
        
        ```
        pip install libfmp
        ```
        
        ## Contributing
        
        The libfmp-package goes hand in hand with the FMP notebooks. In particular, we need to manually synchronize all libfmp-functions with text passages, explanations, and code in the FMP notebooks. Of course, we are happy for suggestions and contributions. However, to facilitate the synchronization, we would be grateful for either directly contacting us via email (meinard.mueller@audiolabs-erlangen.de) or for creating [an issue](https://github.com/meinardmueller/libfmp/issues) in our Github repository. Please do not submit a pull request without prior consultation with us.
