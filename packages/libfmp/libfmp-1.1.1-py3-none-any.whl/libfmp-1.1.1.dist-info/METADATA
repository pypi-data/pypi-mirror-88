# libfmp

This repository contains the Python package libfmp. This package goes hand in hand with the FMP Notebooks, a collection of educational material for teaching and learning Fundamentals of Music Processing (FMP) with a particular focus on the audio domain. For detailed explanations and example appliciations of the libfmp-functions we refer to the FMP Notebooks:

http://audiolabs-erlangen.de/FMP

The FMP notebooks also contain a dedicated notebook for libfmp:

## Installing

You can install libfmp using the Python package manager pip:

```
pip install libfmp
```

## Contributing

The libfmp-package has been developed in the context of the FMP notebooks. Being an integral part, all libfmp-functions need to manually synchronized with text passages, explanations, and the code in the FMP notebooks. Of course, we are happy for suggestions and contributions. However, to facilitate the synchronization, we would be grateful for either directly contacting us via email (meinard.mueller@audiolabs-erlangen.de) or for creating [an issue](https://github.com/meinardmueller/libfmp/issues) in our Github repository. Please do not submit a pull request without prior consultation with us.
