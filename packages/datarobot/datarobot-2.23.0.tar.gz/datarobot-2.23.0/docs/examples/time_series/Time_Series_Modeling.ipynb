    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This example provides an introduction to a few of DataRobot's time series modeling capabilities with a sales dataset.\n",
    "Here is a list of things we will touch on during this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Installing the `datarobot` package\n",
    "- Configuring the client\n",
    "- Creating a project\n",
    "- Denoting known-in-advance features\n",
    "- Specifying a partitioning scheme\n",
    "- Running the automated modeling process\n",
    "- Generating predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "In order to run this notebook yourself, you will need the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- This notebook. If you are viewing this in the HTML documentation bundle, you can download all of the example notebooks and supporting materials from [Downloads](../index.rst).\n",
    "- The required datasets, which is included in the same directory as this notebook.\n",
    "- A DataRobot API token. You can find your API token by logging into the DataRobot Web User Interface and looking in your `Profile`.\n",
    "- The `xlrd` Python package is needed for the pandas `read_excel` function. You can install this with `pip install xlrd`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing the `datarobot` package\n",
    "The `datarobot` package is hosted on PyPI. You can install it via:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install datarobot\n",
    "```\n",
    "from the command line. Its main dependencies are `numpy` and `pandas`, which could take some time to install on a new system. We highly recommend use of virtualenvs to avoid conflicts with other dependencies in your system-wide python installation."

    "- A DataRobot API token - a token the server uses to identify and validate the user making API requests\n",

We could manually add a column to the dataset to indicate which rows should be used for training, test, and validation, but it is straightforward to allow DataRobot to do it automatically.
