'''
pyuvm uses the Python logging system to do reporting.  Still, we need this base class
to be true to the hierarchy.  Every instance of a child class has its own logger.

There may be a need to implement uvm_info, uvm_error, uvm_warning, and uvm_fatal, but
it would be best to first see how the native Python logging system does the job.
