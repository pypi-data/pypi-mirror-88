# Sphinx plugin for Antlr4

A4Doc is a sphinx plugin for documenting Antlr4 grammars.

Itâ€™s primary target is to provide some overview for DSL users
(generated documentation may not include some nuances essential
for compiler developers).

A4Doc's features are:

- a new domain with grammar and rule directives called ``a4``;
- directives for rendering railroad diagrams;
- directive for extracting documentation comments and rendering docs and
  diagrams from `.g4` source files.
