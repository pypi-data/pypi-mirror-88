        Wiz is an environment management framework which consists of a Python API and a
        command line tool. It can be used to run a command within a deterministic
        environment resolved from one or several package requests.
        
        The packages are defined in package definitions which are stored in one or
        several registries.
        
        The command line tool can be used as follows::
        
            >>> wiz use "app==2.*" my-plugin -- AppExe /path/to/script
        
        Equivalent commands can be executed using the Python API:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import subprocess
            import wiz
        
            # Resolve context.
            context = wiz.resolve_context(["app==2.*", "my-plugin"])
        
            # Run command within environment.
            command = context["command"]["AppExe"]
            subprocess.call(command, environ=context["environ"])
