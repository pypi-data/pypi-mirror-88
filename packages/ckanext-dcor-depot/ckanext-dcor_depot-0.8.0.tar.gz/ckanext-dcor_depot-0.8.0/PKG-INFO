Description: ckanext-dcor_depot
        ==================
        
        This plugin manages how data are stored in DCOR. There are two types of
        files in DCOR:
        
        1. Resources uploaded by users, imported from figshare, or
           imported from a data archive
        2. Ancillary files that are generated upon resource creation, such as
           condensed DC data, preview images (see
           `ckanext-dc_view <https://github.com/DCOR-dev/ckanext-dc_view>`_).
        
        This plugin implements:
        
        - Data storage management. All resources uploaded by a user are moved
          to ``/data/users-HOSTNAME/USERNAME-ORGNAME/PK/ID/PKGNAME_RESID_RESNAME``
          and symlinks are created in ``/data/ckan-HOSTNAME/resources/RES/OUR/CEID``.
          CKAN itself will not notice this. The idea is to have a filesystem overview
          about the datasets of each user.
        - Import datasets from figshare. Existing datasets from figshare are
          downloaded to the ``/data/depots/figshare`` directory and, upon resource
          creation, symlinked there from  ``/data/ckan-HOSTNAME/resources/RES/OUR/CEID``
          (Note that this is an exemption of the data storage management described
          above). When running the following command, the "figshare-import" organization
          is created and the datasets listed in ``figshare_dois.txt`` are added to CKAN:
        
          ::
        
             ckan -c /etc/ckan/default/ckan.ini import-figshare
        
        
        - Import datasets from an internal depot. The depot should be present
          at ``/data/depots/internal/`` and follow the directory structure
          ``201X/2019-08/20/2019-08-20_1126_c083de*`` where the allowed file names
          in this case are
        
          - ``2019-08-20_1126_c083de.sha256sums`` a file containing SHA256 sums
          - ``2019-08-20_1126_c083de_v1.rtdc`` the actual measurement
          - ``2019-08-20_1126_c083de_v1_condensed.rtdc`` the condensed dataset
          - ``2019-08-20_1126_c083de_ad1_m001_bg.png`` an ancillary image
          - ``2019-08-20_1126_c083de_ad2_m002_bg.png`` another ancillary image
          - ...
        
          ::
        
             ckan -c /etc/ckan/default/ckan.ini import-internal
        
        
        Please make sure that the necessary file permissions are given in ``/data``. 
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            pip install ckanext-dcor_depot
        
        
        Add this extension to the plugins and defaul_views in ckan.ini:
        
        ::
        
            ckan.plugins = [...] dcor_depot
            ckan.storage_path=/data/ckan-HOSTNAME
            ckanext.dcor_depot.depots_path=/data/depots
            ckanext.dcor_depot.users_depot_name=users-HOSTNAME
        
        This plugin stores resources to `/data`:
        
        ::
        
            mkdir -p /data/depots/users-$(hostname)
            chown -R www-data /data/depots/users-$(hostname)
