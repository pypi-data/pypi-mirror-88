Description: # GitHub Action template
        
        This project helps to create [custom GitHub actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/creating-actions)
        with Python 3.

        ## Features
        
        There are two ways to create a custom action: either by using JavaScript or
        by [providing a Docker container](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-docker-container-action)
        that allows to use just any language.
        
        This project helps to code a Python 3.8+ custom action, by providing:
        
        - a [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template to generate a boilerplate project including
          Dockerfile, sample action code and metadata
        - a Python package (this package) to serve as a lightweight framework for actions, used by our cookiecutter-generated 
          action
